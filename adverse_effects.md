#Adverse effects {#id}
>Classify and describe adverse drug effects.

An **adverse effect** is:
* A noxious or unintended effect associated with administration of a drug at the **normal dose**
    * i.e., not an overdose
    * Occur:
        * Mainly in young and middle-aged individuals
        * Twice as common in women
        * May be exacerbated by asthma and pregnancy.
* Distinct from an **adverse event**, which is an untoward occurance during treatment that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to drug administration

Adverse effects can be classified by mechanism as follows:

##Type A Adverse Reactions
These are related to the pharmacological action of the drug. They are:
* Common
* Related to dose (dose-response relationship)
* Temporally associated with drug administration
* Reproducible
* Pharmacologically predictable based on understanding of the drug in question
    * e.g hypokaleamia secondary to diuretic use

They typically result in:
* Organ-selective injury
* More pronounced with long-term use and in risk groups:
    * Extremes of age
    * Pregnancy
    * Renal failure
* High morbidity but low mortality  
Treatment is to decrease dose.

##Type B Adverse Reactions
These are patient-specific or idiosyncratic reactions. They are:
* Rare  
  Potentially genetic, but poorly understood.
* Indepdendent of dose  
    * Occur with low doses
    * Do not have a dose-response relationship
* Not pharmacologically predictable  
Important causes include:
    * Acetylator status
    * CYP450 variants
    * Receptor abnormalities
    * Enzyme alterations/deficiencies  
        * e.g. Suxamethonium apnoea
* Not necessarily reproducable

They typically result in:
* Immunoallergic reactions
* Pseudoallergy
* Idiosyncratic reaction
* Low morbidity but high mortality
    * e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or anaphylaxis following penicillin administration

Treatment is to cease the medication.

##Type C Adverse Reactions
These are 'statistical effects' associated with monitoring. They are:
* Typically an increased frequency of background disease that is detected due to increased screening
* Atypical for a drug reaction and not pharmacological predictable
* No identifiable temporal relationship
* Not reproducable
