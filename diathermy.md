> <p style="color:purple";> Discuss the principles of surgical diathermy, its safe use and the potential hazards</p>

Diathermy is the use of an electrical current to cut tissue and coagulate blood via localised heating. Diathermy:
* Uses **high frequency**, **alternating current** passing between two electrodes  
Frequencies between 300kHz and 2MHz are used, which have a negligible risk of inducing arrhythmia.
* Heat energy produced is proportional to electrical power dissipated ($$I^2R$$)
* Relies on the principle of current density  
$$Current / Density = {Current \over Area}$$
    * A high current density at the electrode causes tissue damage, a low current density (e.g. at the plate of a unipolar electrode) causes heating without damage.

##Diathermy Types
Diathermy can be either:
* **Unipolar**  
Consists of a probe containing one electrode, and a large plate (placed elsewhere on the patient) containing the other probe.
* **Bipolar**  
Consists of a pair of forceps with each point containing a separate electrode. Minimises the current passing between probes, and is used when using diathermy on electrically sensitive tissues (e.g. brain).

##Diathermy Modes
Diathermy modes include:
* Cutting  
Low-voltage mode producing a high current in the shape of a continuous sine wave.
* Coagulate  
High-voltage mode producing a damped sine wave response.
* Blended  
Mixture of cutting and coagulate on different tissues.

##Risks
* Burns
* Electrocution  
May injure patient, staff, or damage equipment and implants.
* Electrical Interference  
May inhibit pacing in certain pacemakers, or trigger ICDs.
* Smoke production  
Respiratory irritant, dissemination of viral particles, and may be carcinogenic.
* Tissue dissemination  
Potential source of metastatic seeding.
