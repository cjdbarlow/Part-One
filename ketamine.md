# Ketamine

Ketamine is a phencyclidine derivative used for induction, sedation, analgesia, and as a bronchodilator in severe asthma.

Ketamine acts via:
* **Non-competitive antagonist** of **NMDA** and **glutamate** receptors in the CNS
* Reduces presynaptic glutamate release
* Sodium channel inhibition  
Local anaesthetic-like effect.
* Potential monoaminergic, muscarinic, and nicotinic antagonism

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Phencyclidine derivative|
|**Uses**|Induction of anaesthesia, sedation, analgesia, asthma|
|**Presentation**| Clear, colourless solution forming an acidic solution (pH 3.5-5.5)|
|**Isomerism**| Racemic mixture or the single S(+) enantiomer, which is 2-3x as potent as the R(-) enantiomer but has less bronchodilatory properties|
|**Route of Administration**|IV, IM, PO, PR, PN, via epidural (with preservative-free solution)|
|**Dosing**|Induction: 1-2mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IV, 5-10mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IM, Sedation: 0.2-0.5mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IV|
|**Distribution**|25% protein bound. t<sub>1/2</sub>α 10-15 minutes|
|**Metabolism**| Hepatic metabolism to active norketamine by CYP450 and then to inactive metabolites, t<sub>1/2</sub>β 2-4 hours|
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites. Action of norketamine prolonged in renal failure.|
|**Resp**|Bronchodilation, tachypnea, relative preservation of laryngeal reflexes. Apnoea with rapid injection. Preserved central response to CO<sub>2</sub>.|
|**CVS**|↑ Sympathetic outflow: ↑ HR, ↑ BP, ↑ SVR, ↑ MVO<sub>2</sub>. Acts directly as a myocardial depressant - beware maximally stimulated patient. Depresses baroreceptor reflex.|
|**CNS**|Dissociation, analgesia, emergence phenomena (hallucinations, delirium) reduced by concurrent BDZ administration (increasing risk with higher doses and rapid administration). <br><br>Produces dissociative anaesthesia within 90 seconds by dissociating thalamocortical and limbic systems on EEG. Purposeful movements unrelated to stimulus may occur even during surgical anaesthesia.<br><br>↑ IOP.|
|**Renal**|Cystitis with long-term, high-dose use|
|**GIT**|N/V|
