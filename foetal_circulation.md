# Foetal Circulation

> Explain the physiological changes during pregnancy, and parturition

##In Utero
The foetal circulation has a number of structural differences:
* Two **umbilical arteries**  
The umbilical artery returns deoxygenated blood to the placenta.
  * PO<sub>2</sub> of 18mmhg (SpO<sub>2</sub> 45%)
* One **umbilical vein**  
The umbilical vein supplies oxygenated blood to the foetus.
  * Has a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 28mmHg (SpO<sub>2</sub> 70%)
  * 60% of blood from the umbilical vein enters the IVC
  * 40% of blood enters the liver
* Two ducts:
  * **Ductus venosus**  
  Shunts blood from the umbilical vein to the IVC.
  * **Ductus arteriosus**  
  Shunts blood from the pulmonary trunk to the descending aorta.
* A **foramen ovale**  
Shunts blood from the right atrium to the left atrium.
* **Immature myocardium**  
Foetal myocardium does not obey Starlings Law, and does not adjust contractility for any given preload. Therefore:
  * SV is fixed
  * CO is HR dependent  
  Normal HR at term is 110-160 bpm.

These structural difference alter the pathway of blood circulation:
* Oxygenated blood returns via the umbilical vein
  * 40% flows to the liver
  * 60% is returned to the IVC
* Oxygenated blood in the IVC is directed via the Eustachian valve through the foramen ovale
* Blood returning from the SVC is directed into the RV, and then into the descending aorta by the ductus arteriosus
  * ~10% of RV output flows through the pulmonary circulation
  

This arrangement has several features:
 * Blood with the most oxygen is delivered to the arch vessels to supply the brain
 * Blood with the least oxygen is delivered to the umbilical arteries for gas exchange
 * Both the RV and the LV eject into systemic circulations, and are of similar size and wall thickness

##Changes at Birth
Several changes happen at birth:
* Placental circulation is lost  
There is a transition from circulation in parallel to circulation in series.
* An **FRC is established**  
Reversal of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in a rapid drop in PVR.
* The cord is clamped  
The systemic vascular bed volume falls, and SVR increases.

* The fall in PVR lowers RV afterload  
RAP falls
* The rise in SVR increases LV afterload  
LAP rises
* When LAP exceeds RAP, the foramen ovale closes

* Increased left sided afterload causes **flow reversal** in the ductus arteriosus  
There is progressive closure of the ductus over hours to days, under the influence of prostaglandins and oxygenated blood flowing through the duct.

* The ductus venosus progressively fibroses over a period of days to weeks
