> Describe the factors involved in the process of inflammation and the immune 
response, including innate and acquired immunity

Inflammation is a non-specific response triggered by a pathogen or tissue injury, which aims to limit further tissue damage.

Inflammation is classically characterised by:
* **Pain**
* **Heat**
* **Redness**
* **Swelling**
* **Loss of function**

This is a consequence of:
* Vasodilation  
Increases blood flow to area, which increases supply of immune cells and resources for cellular repair.
* Increased vascular permeability  
Increases extravasation of protein and immune cells.
* Migration of phagocytes  
Remove pathogens and cellular debris.

##Process of Inflammation
* Tissue damage  
    * Trauma causes mechanical disruption of vasculature and mast cell degranulation, causing local inflammation and activation of haemostatic mechanisms
    * Infection stimulates degranulation of local macrophages, releasing inflammatory cytokines and triggering mast cell degranulation


* Local inflammatory response  
    * Histamine causes arteriolar and post-capillary venule dilatation and subsequent extravasation
    * Release of chemotactic molecules attracts circulating inflammatory cells


* Systemic inflammatory response  
Severe inflammation may lead to cytokines in the systemic circulation, causing:
    * Fever
    * Neutrophil recruitment from bone marrow
    * Release of acute-phase proteins from liver
