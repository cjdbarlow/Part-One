# Swallowing
> Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including sphincter function

Swallowing is divided into three phases:
* **Oral Phase**  
    * Voluntary
    * Food is pushed against hard palate by tongue
* **Pharyngeal Phase**  
    * Involuntary - coordinated by medulla
    * Closure of nasopharynx
    * Adduction of vocal cords
    * Hyoid elevation and deflection of epiglottis
    * Pharyngeal contraction  
    Propels food bolus towards oesophagus
* **Oesophageal phase**  
    * Involuntary
    * Closure of UoS  
    Resting **barrier pressure 100mmHg**
    * Relaxation of LoS  
    Resting **barrier pressure 20mmHg**, which is a balance between:
        * LoS pressure (30mmHg)
        * Antral pressure (10mmHg)
    * Oesophageal peristalsis

Impairment of any of these processes increases risk of aspiration:
* Obundation  
Reduced cough reflex
* Muscular weakness
* Impaired medullary coordination
