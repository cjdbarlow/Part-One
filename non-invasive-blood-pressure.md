#Non-Invasive Blood Pressure
> Describe the ~~invasive and~~ non-invasive measurement of blood pressure ~~and cardiac output~~ including calibration, sources of errors and limitations

Non-invasive blood pressure measurements is performed with either a:
* **D**evice for **I**ndirect **N**on-invasive **A**utomatic **M**ean **A**rterial **P**ressure (DINAMAP)  
Automatic blood pressure cuff.
* Von Recklinghausen's oscillotonometer  
"Manual" blood pressure cuff.

##DINAMAP
Components:
* One cuff  
Performs both arterial occlusion and measuremnet.
* Tubing
* Device for inflating the occlusive cuff and gradually deflating it
* Pressure tranducer
* Display

Process:
* Cuff is inflated above SBP
* Cuff deflates at a rate of 2-3mmHg.s<sup>-1</sup>  
When cuff pressure equals:
    * SBP  
    Turbulent flow occurs past the cuff, creating pressure oscillations. The pressure at which these are **first detected** is the **SBP**.
    * MAP  
    The **amplitude** of pressure oscillations is maximal.
* DBP is calculated from MAP and DBP

###Cons
* Requires an appropriately sized cuff  
Cuff should be ~20% greater than arm diameter.
    * Cuffs that are too small will over-read
    * Cuffs that are too wide will under-read
* Requires a regular rhythm
* Inaccurate at extremes of blood pressure
* Inaccurate when used more frequently than once per minute
* Inaccurate when the vessel is incompressible
    * Heavily calcified vessels
    * When applied to forearm/foreleg
* May cause neuropraxia

##Von Recklinghausen's Oscillotonometer
Components:
* Two cuffs
    * Occlusive cuff
    * Measurement cuff
* Tubing
* Device for inflating the occlusive cuff and gradually deflating it
* Pressure tranducer
* Display

Process:
* Cuff is inflated until the radial pressure is no longer palpable  
This is approximates SBP.
* Cuff is deflated, and reinflated to 20mmHg above the estimated SBP
* Cuff is deflated at a rate of 2-3mmHg.s<sup>-1</sup> whilst auscultating the brachial artery  
When cuff pressure equals:
    * SBP  
    Turbulent flow occurs past the cuff, turbulent flow causes the first of the **Korotkoff sounds** (clear tapping pulsations) to be heard.
    * DBP  
    The cuff no longer compresses the vessel at all, so no turbulent flow occurs and nothing is auscultated.
