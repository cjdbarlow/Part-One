# Haemostatic Regulation
> Describe the mechanisms of preventing thrombosis including endothelial factors and natural anticoagulants

Haemostasis must be controlled to prevent rampant clotting of the vascular tree. This involves both endothelial factors and proteins.

##Endothelial Regulation
Intact endothelium and the glycocalyx prevent clotting in a number of ways:
* **Minimise stasis**
    * High blood flow  
    Especially where flow is turbulent (large arteries).
    * Maximise laminar flow  
    Glycocalyx smooths flow.


* **Inhibition of platelet adhesion and activation**  
NO, prostacyclin, and ectonucleotidases  (which degrade ADP) inhibit platelet activation.


* **Membrane-bound anticoagulant proteins**  
    * **Hepar*an*** (not hepar*in*)  
    Activates antithrombin III.
    * **Thrombomodulin**  
    Binds thrombin, preventing cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin. The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates protein C (which in turn inactivates factors Va and VIIIa).


* **Prevent exposure of procoagulant protein**  
    * Collagen
    * vWF
    * Tissue Factor


* **tPA secretion** (see 'Clot Lysis')

##Clot Regulation
* Effect of blood flow
    * Dilutes clotting factors  
    Activated clotting factors are washed away and metabolised by the RES.
    * Laminar flow  
    Causes **axial streaming** of platelets, minimising endothelial contact and chance of activation.fa
* Activation of anticoagulant factors
    * **Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor**  
    Inhibits VIIa, antagonising the action of tissue factor
    * **Antithrombin III**  
    Inhibits the **serine proteases**, i.e. the non-cofactor factors in all three pathways - IIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa.    
    * **Protein C**  
    Inactivates protein Va and VIIIa, and is activated by thrombin.
    * **Protein S**  
    Cofactor which helps protein C.


##Clot Lysis
Clot breakdown is performed by:
* Tissue Plasminogen Activator (**tPA**)  
Binds to fibrin, and then cleaves plasminogen to plasmin. This keeps the plasmin formation in the vicinity of the clot, limiting its systemic spread of.

* **Plasmin** cleaves fibrin into **fibrin degradation products**  
FDPs conveniently inhibit further thrombin and fibrin formation.
