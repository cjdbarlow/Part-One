> Describe the measurement and interpretation of pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity.

Pulmonary function tests are performed with a **spirometer**, which measures either volume or flow (integrated for time) to quantify lung function.

Basic spirometry can be used to quantify:
* Lung volumes and capacities  
All except residual volume (and therefore FRC and TLC).
* Dynamic measurements
    * FEV<sub>1</sub>  
    Volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second.
    * FVC  
    Forced vital capacity.
    * PEFR  
    Peak expiratory flow rate.
    * Flow-volume loop

Additional testing can be performed to measure:
* Residual volume  
FRC and TLC can therefore be calculated.
* Diffusion capacity

##Basic Spirometry{#basic}
Basic spirometry includes:
* Forced spirometry  
Patient forcibly exhales a vital capacity breath, producing a exponential (wash-in) curve. This calculates:
    * PEFR from the gradient at time 0 (assuming maximal effort)
    * FEV<sub>1</sub> is the volume expired in 1s  
    Normal is > 80% of predicted.
    * FVC is the total volume exhaled.
    * The FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio  
    Normal is > 0.7.
    * These values also quantify disease severity:
      * In obstructive airways disease:
        * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
        * FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.7
      * Restrictive disease:
        * FEV<sub>1</sub> <80% predicted
        * FVC <80% predicted
        * FEV/FVC ratio >0.7  
        The ratio is normal as the FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC fall proportionally.

* Volume-Time Graph (also known as a spirograph or spirogram)  
Quantifies static lung volumes by having a patient perform:
  * Normal tidal breathing
  * Vital capacity breath
  * Vital capacity exhalation

##Flow-Volume Loops{#loop}

* **Normal**
  * Peak expiratory flow of **~8L.s<sup>-1</sup>**  
  Initial flow is highest as the increased lung volume **increases the calibre** of lung airways, reducing airways resistance.
    * This is called the **effort dependent** part of the curve
  * Flow tails off later in expiration  
    * Lungs collapse, and airway calibre falls
    * Small airways are compressed  
    Any increase in expiratory pressure will increase airway resistance proportionally.
      * This is called **dynamic airways compression**, and results in a uniform flow rate that is **independent of expiratory effort**  
      This is therefore labeled the **effort independent** part of the curve.

* **Obstructive lung disease**  
  * RV and TLC are increased due to gas trapping
  * Peak flow is limited
  * Effort-independent portion becomes concave
  
<img src="\resources\flow-volume-obs.svg">

   
* **Restrictive lung disease**
  * TLC is reduced, but residual volume is unchanged
  * Peak flow may be reduced (as seen here)  
  However, this reduction is **proportional** to the decrease in volume, such that the FEV<sub>1</sub>:FVC ratio is normal. If peak flow is preserved, the FEV<sub>1</sub>:FVC ratio will be increased.
  * Effort independent part is linear

* **Fixed upper airway obstruction**  
Describes an upper airway obstruction that does not change calibre during the respiratory cycle.
  * Peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates are limited by the stenosis

<img src="\resources\flow-volume-fixed.svg">


* **Variable *extrathoracic* obstruction**  
Variable as the obstruction changes during the respiratory cycle:
  * During (negative pressure) inspiration the lesion is pulled into trachea, reducing inspiratory flow
  * During expiration the lesion is pushed out of the trachea  
  The way to remember this is an **extra**thoracic obstruction impedes **in**spiration
  * The reverse effect occurs in positive pressure ventilation

<img src="\resources\flow-volume-extra.svg">


* **Variable *intrathoracic* obstruction**  
The opposite to extrathoracic obstruction.
  * During inspiration the airway calibre increases and inspiratory flow is unimpeded
  * During expiration the airway calibre falls and expiratory flow is reduced
