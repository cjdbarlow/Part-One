# Functional Anatomy and Control of Renal Blood Flow {#id}
>Describe the functional anatomy of the kidneys and renal blood flow.

##Functional Anatomy
The functional unit of the kidney is the **nephron**. Nephrons:
* Are composed of the glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct
* Are divided by their location into:
    * **Superficial cortical** nephrons  
    Have **short loops** of Henle.
    * **Juxtamedullary** nephrons  
    Have **long loops** of Henle, and the efferent arteriole forms the vasa recta for the kidney.
    * **Mid-cortical nephrons**  
    May have either long or short loops.

##Control of Renal Blood flow
The kidneys:
* Receive **22% of cardiac output** at rest
* Extract only **10% of delivered O<sub>2</sub>**
* Have a **high renal blood flow** exceeds that required for metabolism  
High flow is instead needed **to produce** the large volume of **glomerular filtrate** (125ml.min<sup>-1</sup>) required for excretion of waste.


###Autoregulation
Renal blood flow is **autoregulated** over a wide range of mean arterial pressures (60-160mmHg) via:
* **Myogenic** autoregulation
* **Tubuloglomerular** feedback



**Myogenic** autoregulation:
* Describes the intrinsic constriction of the afferent arteriole in response to an increased transmural pressure
* This increases vascular resistance in proportion to the increase in pressure, keeping flow constant

**Tubuloglomerular feedback** is more complicated, and describes the constriction or dilation of the afferent arteriole in response to adenosine or NO (respectively) release from the macula densa:
* The macula densa lies in the wall of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle
* It detects change in tubular flow rate (probably via changing Na<sup>+</sup> flux across its membrane)
    * Increased flow in the loop indicates an increased perfusion pressure, prompting release of adenosine and constriction of the afferent arteriole
    * Decreased flow indicates a decreased perfusion pressure, reducing adenosine release and prompting the release of NO and renin, which causes the afferent arteriole to dilate


Notably, flow to **juxtamedullary** nephrons is **not autoregulated**. High blood pressure  increases juxtamedullary flow, increasing GFR and impairing renal concentration, resulting in a **pressure diuresis**.

###Neuronal Control
The kidneys are innervated by noradrenergic sympathetic nerves, which causes:
* Afferent and efferent arteriolar constriction  
This increases capillary hydrostatic pressure (increasing filtration) and also increases capillary oncotic pressure (decreasing filtration).
    * This leads to an overall slight reduction in GFR

###Hormonal Control
**Renin**:
* Is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus by β<sub>1</sub> stimulation
* Catalyses the production of angiotensin I from circulating angiotensinogen  
Angiotensin I is then converted into Angiotensin II by circulating ACE.

The actions of the RAAS are described in more detail in the [endocrine functions of the kidney](endocrine_functions_of_the_kidney.md).
