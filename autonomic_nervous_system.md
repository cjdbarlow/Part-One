# Autonomic Nervous System
>Describe the autonomic nervous system, including anatomy, receptors, subtypes and transmitters (including their synthesis, release and fate)

The ANS controls is the part of the nervous system which regulates involuntary and visceral functions. These include:
* Haemodynamics
* Digestion
* Urination and defecation
* Thermoregulation
* Sexual function

The autonomic nervous system can be divided into
* **Central ANS**  
Control occurs in the **hypothalamus**, **brainstem**, and **spinal cord**.
* **Peripheral ANS**  
Divided anatomically and functionally into the:
  * **Sympathetic** nervous system  
  * **Parasympathetic** nervous system

##Central Control
The hypothalamus controls autonomic functions by neural and endocrine mechanisms. It is subdivided anatomically into four regions:

* **Anterior hypothalamus**  
  Controls the PNS and thermoregulation. It also **releases ADH** in response to increased plasma osmolality, and **oxytocin**.
* **Medial hypothalamus**  
  Inhibits appetite in response to increase in blood glucose.
* **Lateral hypothalamus**  
  Contains the thirst centre and drive to seek food.
* **Posterior hypothalamus**  
  Controls vasomotor centres, modulating sympathetic vasoconstriction, as well as positive and negative inotropy and chronotropy. Also modulates wakefulness in response to sympathetic stimulii.

Signals from the hypothalamus have a tonic output to:
* All smooth muscle
* Heart
* Exocrine organs
* Endocrine organs
* GIT
* GU

##Central Anatomy
In the grey matter of the spinal cord, efferent nerves synapse with two other nerves connected in series. This maintains tonic autonomic outflow.

**Efferent** nerves exit the spinal root anteriorly, and form the **ventral root ganglion**.

Conversely, **afferent** nerves enter the root posteriorly, forming the **dorsal root ganglion** before synapsing in the spinal cord.

##Sympathetic Nervous System
The sympathetic nervous system optimises the body for short-term survival.

Sympathetic innervation is from the **sympathetic trunks**. These:
* Are a paired bundle of sympathetic neurons which run lateral to the vertebral bodies from **T1 to L2**  
The trunk is subdivided into four parts:
  * The **cervical part** innervates the head, neck, and part of the thorax
  * The **thoracic part** is further subdivided into:
    * Upper thoracic from T1-T5, which innervates the aorta, heart, and lungs
    * Lower thoracic from T6-T12, which innervates the foregut and midgut
  * The **lumbar part** forms the coeliac plexus
  * The **pelvic part** innervate the pelvic visceral and lower limb vasculature
* Contain the sympathetic ganglion, which is a synapse between the:
  * **Short pre-ganglionic fibre**  
  Cell body is located in the lateral horn of the spinal cord, and connects to the sympathetic ganglion.
    * Releases ACh to stimulate the post-ganglionic fibre.
  * **Long post-ganglionic fibre**  
  Cell body is located in the sympathetic ganglion, and stimulates the effect site.
    * Has a nicotinic ACh receptor
    * Releases NA at the effect site
    * Sensitivity (for ACh) and activity (for NA release) is modulated by a number of other substances:
      * Enkephalin
      * Neuropeptide Y
      * Dopamine
      * Adrenaline
      * Prostaglandin
      * GABA
      * Neurotensin
      
There are three exceptions to the above structure:
* The **adrenal gland** is a **modified sympathetic ganglion**. It is:
  * Directly innervated by preganglionic neurons releasing ACh
* Sweat glands have muscarinic receptors, and are stimulated by ACh rather than noradrenaline
* Skeletal muscle metarterioles also have muscarinic ACh receptors, and are stimulated by ACh

###Effect
Sympathetic stimulation has a number of effects by either direct neural innervation or adrenaline release. They are consistent with a 'fight or flight' response, and optimise the body for short-term stress conditions.

|Effector Organ|Sympathetic Innervation|Response|
|--|--|--|
|**Eye**|Cervical|Pupillary dilatation
|**Lungs**|Thoracic|Bronchodilation
|**Heart**|Thoracic|↑ HR, ↑ inotropy, ↑ conduction velocity
|**Vasculature**|Sacral|Constriction
|**MSK**|Sacral|Sweating, contraction, lipolysis
|**Endocrine**|Lower thoracic|Adrenaline and noradrenaline release
|**GIT**|Thoracic, lumbar|Decreased salivation and GIT motility, increased sphincter tone, gluconeogenesis
|**GU**|Pelvic|Detrusor relaxation, sphincter contraction, ↑ uterine tone

##Parasympathetic Nervous System
Parasympathetic innervation arises from the:
* **Cranial nerves**  
From CN III, VII, IX, and (mostly) X.
  * The vagus is the major cranial parasympathetic, innervating the:
    * Heart and lungs via the pulmonary and cardiac plexuses
    * Stomach, liver, spleen, and pancreas, and gut proximal to the splenic flexure via the gastric plexus.
* **Hypogastric plexus**  
Arises from S2-S4, and innervates the bladder, uterus, and gut distal to the splenic flexure.

The parasympathetic nervous system ganglia site close to the target organ. This means that the:
* Pre-ganglionic fibre is long  
  * Preganglionic cell body sits within the brainstem (cranial nerves) or sacral grey matter (hypogastric plexus)
  * Releases ACh to stimulate the post-ganglionic neurone
* Post-ganglionic fibre is short
  * Releases ACh to stimulate the target organ

###Effect

|Effector Organ|Parasympathetic Innervation|Response|
|--|--|--|
|**CNS**|CN III via the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, CN VII|Pupillary constriction (CN III), lacrimation (CN VII)
|**Lungs**|CN X|Bronchoconstriction, increased mucous production
|**Heart**|CN X|↓ HR, ↓ inotropy, ↓ conduction velocity
|**GIT**|CN VII (submaxillary and mandibular salivary glands), CNIX (parotid gland), CNX (stomach to proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon), hypogastric plexus (distal one-third of the transverse colon to rectum)|Salivation, decreased sphincter tone, increased motility
|**GU**|Hypogastric plexus|Detrusor contraction, erection

##Enteric Plexus
The **enteric plexus** is a system of autonomic nerves in the GIT which is free of CNS control. It consists of sensory and integrative neurons as well as excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons which generate coordinated muscular activity.
