#Control of Gastric Emptying
> Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including sphincter function.

Gastric emptying is a neurally and hormonally mediated process which aims to present food to the small bowel in a controlled manner. Different drugs, hormones, and physiological states can either encourage or inhibit gastric emptying.

##Determinants of Gastric Emptying
**Rate of gastric emptying** is a function of:
* **Antral pressure**  
Main determinant as pyloric resistance tends to be low, and is affected by:
    * Stomach
    * Duodenum
    * Systemic factors
    * Drugs
* **Pyloric resistance**

###Stomach
* Gastric **distension**  
  Vagal excitation from gastric stretch causes release of **gastrin**, increasing peristaltic frequency
* Composition of chyme:
    * **Liquids** empty **faster** than **solids**
        * Liquids have a half-time of ~20 minutes, and empty in an exponential fashion
        * Solids have a half-time of ~ 2 hours, with a dwell time of ~30 minutes, and empty in a linear fashion
    * Protein independently stimulates gastrin release

###Duodenum
The duodenum has hormonal mechanisms which have a negative feedback on gastric emptying. These include:
* **Duodenal distension**
* **Hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar** chyme
* **Acid**ic chyme  
  In reponse to acid the duodenum releases **secretin** and **somatostatin**. Secretin directly inhibits gastric smooth muscle, whilst somatostatin **inhibits** the release of **gastrin**.
* **Fat** and **protein**  
  Fat and protein breakdown products stimulate release of **cholecystokinin**, which **inhibits gastrin**
    * Carbohydrate-rich meals empty faster than protein, which empty faster than fat.


###Systemic
* **Motilin** released by the small bowel enhances the strength of the **migrating motor complex**, a peristaltic wave of contraction through the whole GIT which occurs every 60-90 minutes
* **Sympathetic** input from the coeliac plexus **inhibits** gastric emptying
* Pregnancy has a number of effecs on gastric emptying:
    * Progesterone relaxes smooth muscle and inhibits gastric smooth muscle response to ACh and gastrin, as well as creating incompetence of the LoS leading to GORD
    * Gastrin production increases (it is produced by the placenta)
    * Gastric acid production is increased during the the third trimester
* **Parasympathetic** input enhances gastric motility


###Effect of drugs
Drugs which increase gastric emptying include:
* Metoclopramide
* Erythromycin

Drugs which inhibit gastric emptying include:
* Opioids
* Alcohol
* Anticholinergic agents
