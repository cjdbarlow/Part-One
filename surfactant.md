# Surfactant

> Describe the properties, production and regulation of, surfactant and relate these to its role in influencing respiratory mechanics

##Surface Tension
* Surface tension describes the tendency of a fluid to minimise its surface area
* It is related to the attraction between particles in the fluid relative to particles outside the fluid
* Surface tension is why:
  * Water scattered on a surface forms rounded droplets
  * Why multiple droplets will tend to coalesce into a single larger droplet


* This relationship is described by **La Place's Law**  
$$ P = {2T \over r}$$[^1], where:
  * $$P$$ is pressure
  * $$T$$ is surface tension
  * $$r$$ is radius


* Alveoli obey Laplace's Law
* High surface tension causes three problems with alveoli
  * Compliance falls when the alveolus is empty  
  As the radius falls, the pressure required to open it (at a given surface tension) will be increased. This increases work of breathing.
  * Smaller alveoli will preferentially empty into bigger alveoli  
    Smaller alveoli require greater transmural pressures to remain inflated. This causes smaller alveoli to empty into larger ones.
 * Fluid transudation  
    Surface tension draws fluid from interstitial spaces and contributes to pulmonary oedema.
 
 
 * Overall, high surface tension is detrimental to the lungs

##Surfactant
* Surfactant is substance which substantially reduces work of breathing by reducing alveolar surface tension
* Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar cells in response to lung inflation and respiration
* It is composed of:
  *  85% phopholipid
  *  5% neutral lipid
  *  10% protein
* Surfactant is **amphipathic**  
Each component has a hydrophobic and hydrophlic end.
  * This causes the molecules to orient themselves along the air-liquid interface, disrupting the attractive bonds between water molecules
  * Surface tension is reduced in proportion to the concentration of molecules
* The concentration of surfactant changes throughout the respiratory cycle
  * During expiration alveoli collapse
  * The decrease in vessel radius is offset by the increase in surfactant concentration, so the fall in radius is mitigated by the drop in surface tension
