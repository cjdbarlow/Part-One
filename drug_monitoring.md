#Drug Monitoring
> Explain clinical drug monitoring with regard to peak and trough concentrations, minimum therapeutic concentration and toxicity

Drug monitoring:
* Describes the individualisation of dosing by maintaining plasma drug levels within a target range
* Is important in adjusting dose to account for inter-patient variability in response  
Variability can be:  
  * Pharmacokinetic  
  Adjusting drug dose by monitoring plasma levels reduces pharmacokinetic variability.
  * Pharmacodynamic  
  Drug dose is adjusted by evaluating the clinical effect. 

Drug levels are measured to ensure the concentration is above the minimum therapeutic concentration but below toxic levels:
* **Minimum therapeutic concentration**  
The ED<sub>50</sub>, i.e. the dose required to have an effect in 50% of the population.
  * Determines desired **trough levels**  
* **Minimum toxic concentration**  
The LD<sub>50</sub>, or the dose which is lethal in 50% of the population.  
  * Determines the acceptable **peak levels**

From these levels two related terms are derived:
* Therapeutic range (also known as the therapeutic window)  
**Difference** between these levels.
* Therapeutic index  
**Ratio** between these levels, i.e.  
$$ Therapeutic \ Index = {LD_{50} \over ED_{50}} $$
  * A higher therapeutic index gives a greater margin for safety

##Indications
Drugs are monitored in order to:
* Avoid **toxicity**
* Adjust dosing for **efficacy**  
* **Monitor** compliance or determine failure of therapy

Drugs that typically require monitoring have a:
* Narrow target range
* Significant pharmacokinetic variability
* Relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effects
* Determined concentration range
* Validated monitoring assay

Drugs where the effect can be measured clinically (e.g. antihypertensives) tend to be adjusted based on observed effects. This is not possible when:
* The clinical response is the *absence* of a condition, e.g. antiepileptics
* The drug has a narrow therapeutic range


Drugs commonly monitored in the ICU setting include:

| Drug | Therapeutic Range |
| -- | -- |
| Digoxin | 0.8-2 microgram/L |
| Vancomycin | 10-20 mg/L* |
| Tacrolimus | 5-20 microgram/L  |
| Serolimus | 5-15 microgram/L  |
| Phenytoin |10-20 mg/L|
|***Trough**|

##Timing of samples
* Sampling for **toxicity** should occur at times of **peak concentration**  
  * This requires accounting for absorption and distribution
    * e.g. Digoxin levels should be performed >6 hours following a dose to allow time for distribution to occur
  * If symptomatic, samples taken at this time may demonstrate toxic concentrations


* Sampling for **monitoring** should ideally occur at **steady state**
  * i.e. after 4-5 elimination half-lives
  * For drugs with very long half-lives (such as amiodarone), sampling tends to occur earlier to ensure toxic levels have not been reached, as steady state may take months to achieve


* For drugs with short half-lives, **trough levels** (i.e. pre-dose levels) should be taken  
This is the least variable point in the dosing interval.
* For drugs with long half lives, timing of sampling is less important

##Interpretation
Interpretation of drug levels is dependent on:
* **Timing** of sample
* Duration of treatment at the current dose and **dosing** schedule
* Individual characteristics that may affect the **pharmacokinetics**
    * Age
    * Physiology
    * Comorbidities (hepatic, renal, cardiac)
    * Drug interactions
    * Genetics
    * Environmental
* **Protein binding**  
  * Assays measure bound and unbound drug  
  Only unbound drug is pharmacologically active.
  * If binding is changed by disease or displacement by other drug, the proportion of unbound drug may change and targeted levels may need to be adjusted accordingly
* **Active metabolites**  
  Active metabolites are not measured but will contribute to the response.
