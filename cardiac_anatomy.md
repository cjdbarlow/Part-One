##Echocardiographic Anatomy
The left ventricle is:
* Divided into four parts  
From base to apex, in **equal thirds** along the long axis of the ventricle:
	* Basal
	* Mid-cavity  
	Identified by presence of the papillary muscles.
	* Apical
	* Apex  
	Tip of the ventricle, beyond where the cavity ends.
* Each part is divided into segments  
Total of **seventeen segments** between:
	* 6 basal and mid-cavity segments
		* Inferior  
		Mid-cavity contains the postero-medial papillary muscle.
		* Inferoseptal
		* Inferolateral
		* Anterior
		* Antero-septal
		* Antero-lateral  
		Mid-cavity contains the anterolateral papillary muscle.
	* 4 apical segments
		* Inferior
		* Anterior
		* Lateral
		* Septal
	* Apical cap  


###Coronary Supply
The segments of the basal and mid-cavity parts are supplied by all three vessels:

In the apical part, the:
* LAD  
Supplies:
	* Anterior
	* Septal
* LCx  
Supplies:
	* Lateral
* RCA  
Supplies:
	* Inferior

The apical cap is supplied by the **LAD**.
