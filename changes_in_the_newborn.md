#Respiratory Changes in Neonates and Children

##Transition at Birth{#trans}
Transition from placental gas exchange to pulmonary gas exchange occurs within 20s after birth:
* Compression of the thorax through the vaginal canal expels foetal lung water
* Elastic recoil, combined with cooling of the skin and mechanical stimulation (which stimulate the respiratory centre), facilitate first breath

* The rapid drop in pulmonary vascular resistance with spontaneous breathing drives the changes in the cardiac circulation

* The **first three breaths** establish functional residual capacity  
Large changes in intrathoracic pressure in the first three breaths pressure drive alveolar amniotic fluid into the circulation, and establish FRC.

##Neonates and Children
* **Compliance**  
Neonatal chest walls are highly compliant relative to their lungs (due to both a reduced lung compliance and increased chest wall compliance), as compared to adults where lung and chest compliance is equal. Therefore elastic work of breathing is largely determined by the lungs.


* **Oxygenation**  
  * O<sub>2</sub> consumption is ~10ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> in neonates, and 6ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>.min<sup>-1</sup> in children
  * There is a ~10% shunt after birth which contributes to a greater A-a gradient


* **Ventilation**  
  * Obligate nose breathers
  * Increased CO<sub>2</sub> production due to higher metabolic rate
  * Increased minute ventilation, which is due to increased respiratory rate (25-40 breaths per minute)


* **Neurological control of breathing**  
Respiratory patterns change following birth, and complete change to adult respiratory patterns may take some weeks. Patterns include:
  * **Periodic breathing** is a slowly oscillating respiratory rate and V<sub>T</sub>
  * **Periodic apnoea** is intermittent apnoea interspersed with normal breathing.


* **Volumes and capacities**  
  * Closing capacity is increased relative to adults, causing shunt
  * Functional residual capacity is unchanged
  * Tidal volume and dead space are unchanged


* **Laryngeal anatomy**  
  * Large head
  * Large tongue
  * Large, stiff, U-shaped epiglottis
  * Elevated larynx  
  Glottis is at C-3C4 (C6 in adults).
  * Upper airway is narrowest at the cricoid ring (rather than the glottis).
  * Trachea is shorter and narrower  
  4-5cm long, 6mm diameter in the neonate.
  
  
* **Small airways**  
  * Reduced bronchial smooth muscle so bronchospasm is uncommon
  * Bronchioles contribute 50% of airways resistance  
  Bronchiolitis much more distressing in neonates and children.
