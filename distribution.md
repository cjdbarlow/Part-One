# Distribution

> Describe factors influencing the distribution of drugs.

Drug distribution is dependent on many factors, all of which can be related to Fick's Law of Diffusion:
* **Concentration gradient**

* **Tissue mass**


* **Molecular Weight**  
Larger molecules are less able to cross cell membranes, and so a greater portion will remain in the compartment they are delivered to.


* **Lipid Solubility**


* **Ionisation**  
Ionised drugs are polar, and so are less lipid soluble.
  * Ionisation is a function of:
    * pKa  
    The pKa is the pH at which a weak acid or weak base will be 50% ionised.
      * As solvent pH changes, the proportion of ionised vs. unionised drug will differ  
      * How depends on whether the drug is an acid or base:
        * **B**ases are ionised **B**elow their pKa
        * **A**cids are ionised **A**bove their pKa
    * pH  
    In combination with pKa, affects the ionised portion.
  * Unionised drugs:
    * Cross cell membranes more readily than the ionised form
    * Are typically hepatic metabolised
    * Are typically not renally eliminated
  * Ionised drugs:
    * Are typically renally excreted without undergoing metabolism
    * Are poorly lipid soluble and do not cross cell membranes readily
    * May be ion trapped  
    This occurs when an unionised drug moves across a membrane and becomes ionised due to a change in pH. The now-insoluble drug is trapped in the new compartment. This is relevant in:
      * Placenta  
      Foetal pH is lower than maternal pH, which can trap basic drugs \(e.g. LA, opioids\) in foetus.
        * This becomes more significant with a greater divergence of pH \(e.g. placental insufficiency\)
      * Renal elimination  
      Urinary alkalinisation is used to accelerate elimination of acidic drugs, as they become ionised and trapped in urine.

* **Protein binding**  
Proteins and drugs may be bound together by weak bonds. These include ionic bonds, van der Waal's forces, and hydrogen bonds.
  * Drugs may bind to proteins in:
    * Plasma
      * **Albumin**  
      Binds acid and neutral drugs.
        * High capacity
        * Two major binding sites (six total)
          * Site I \(warfarin\)
          * Site II \(diazepam\)
      * **α1-acid glycoprotein**  
      Binds basic drugs.
        * Single binding site
        * Low capacity  
        Typically results in lower total binding (compared to albumin) of alkaline drugs, despite its increased affinity.
      * Lipoprotein  
      For lipid soluble drugs.
    * Tissue
    * Receptor
  * Protein binding is important as:
    * Only unbound drugs are able to:
      * Cross cell membranes
      * Interact with receptors
      * Undergo metabolism  
      Reduced protein binding increases clearance of drugs with low **extraction ratios**.
      * Be filtered by the kidney
    * Highly tissue bound drugs:
      * Have a long duration of action
      * Have a high volume of distribution, prolonging their elimination  
      * May build up in tissues, leading to adverse effects  
      e.g. Corneal deposition, lung fibrosis.
  * Protein binding is affected by:
    * Affinity of drug for protein
      * Ionised drugs do not bind to protein  
      pH.
      * Competition between drugs for binding sites
    * Amount of protein
      * Disease  
        Due to:
        * Hypoalbuminaemia  
          Negative acute phase reactant.
        * Increased α1-acid glycoprotein  
          Acute phase reactant.
      * Competition  
      Source of pharmacokinetic interactions.
  * Protein binding *typically*:
    * Correlates with lipid solubility
    * Is important only when it is very high
    * Results in a decreased V<sub>Dss</sub> when plasma binding is high
    * Results in an increased V<sub>Dss</sub> when tissue binding is high
    * Is important in duration of action as it also relates to affinity for *tissue* proteins
    
    
* **Regional blood flow**  
Affects concentration gradients between blood and tissue, and is affected by cardiac output. Regions include:
  * Vessel Rich Group
    * Brain
    * Heart
    * Liver
    * Kidneys
  * Vessel Poor Group  
  Connective tissues:
    * Bones
    * Ligament
    * Teeth
    * Hair
  * Muscle groups
  * Fat
