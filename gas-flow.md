#Gas Flow
> Describe the measurement of flow, pressure and volume of gases

Types of Flow:
* Laminar flow  
Fluid moving in a steady manner without turbulence.
* Turbulent flow  
Irregular fluid movement in radial, axial, and circumferential axes.
    * Laminar flow is more efficient than turbulent flow, as it requires a smaller pressure gradient to generate the same flow
    * For two fluids moving at the same speed, the velocity of individual particles in laminar flow will be both higher and lower 

Devices used to measure gas flow include:
* Variable-orifice Flowmeters
* Pneumotachograph

##Flowmeters
**Constant pressure, variable orifice** flowmeters are found on wall and cylinder gases. They consist of:
* An inverse conical tube (i.e. narrower at the bottom, and wider at the top)
* A needle valve
* A bobbin  
May have a groove which causes the bobbin to spin, confirming it is not stuck.

Method:
* Gas flows from the bottom to the top of the tube
* The bobbin obstructs flow  
Therefore there is a **pressure difference** across it.
    * Remember: $$Pressure = {Force \over Area} = {Mass \times Acceleration \over Area}$$
    * At equilibrium, the pressure exerted by the bobbin on the flow of gas ($$P = {Gravity \times Bobbin \ Mass \over Bobbin \ Cross-Sectional \ Area}$$) is equal to the pressure exerted by the gas on the bobbin
* As flow is increased, the bobbin is pushed further up the flowmeter due to the increased pressure
* The bobbin will reach a new equilibrium position when the orifice of the flowmeter has become wide enough for the pressure on the bobbin to equal the pressure of gravity

* Flowmeters are calibrated for individual gases as:
    * Laminar (typically low flows) flow is proportional to viscosity
    * Turbulent (typically high flows) flow is proportional to density


###Pros
* Cheap
* No additional power supply required
* Accurate  
Readings may be altered by:
    * Change in temperature affects viscosity and density of gas
    * Change in pressure affects density of gas

###Cons
* Must be vertical
* Bobbins can become stuck

##Pneumotachographs
**Constant orifice, variable pressure** flowmeter. Several different designs exist, and include:
* Fleisch pneumotachograph  
    * Consists of several fine bore parallel tubes placed in the gas circuit  
    Decreased radius and increased resistance reduces gas flow velocity, improving laminar flow.
    * A **differential pressure transducer** is placed at either end of the tubes
    * The pressure drop across the tubing is directly proportional to flow
* Pitot tubes  
    * Consists of two tubes placed into the gas circuit:
        * One faces into the gas flow  
        * The other faces away from the gas flow
    * The pressure difference between tubes is proportional to flow

###Pros
* Accurate
* Continual measurement
* Allow calculation of volumes  
$$Volume \ (L) = Flow \ (L.s^{-1}) \times Time \ (s)$$

###Cons
* Increased resistance
* Increased dead space
* Require laminar flow  
Inaccurate when:
    * Flows are higher than what the system is designed for
    * Alteration in gas density
        * Change in gas mixture
    * Alteration in gas temperature
