#Physiology of Vomiting
> Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including sphincter function

Vomiting is the active, forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the stomach. It is different from regurgitation which is a passive process.

It is a mechanism to expel toxic substances from the GIT.

##Stimulation
Stimulants to vomiting can act centrally, or directly in the bowel:
* **Central stimulation**  
    Central stimuli may act directly on the vomiting centre. Others act via the CTZ, which is part of the area postrema located outside of the blood-brain barrier, and so it can be stimulated by circulating substances.
    Central vomiting stimuli include:
    * Direct:
        * Emotion
        * Pain
        * Olfactory
        * Visual
    * Via the CTZ:
        * Vestibular acting on:
            * H<sub>1</sub>
            * ACh
        * Drugs/Toxins acting on:
            * 5-HT<sub>3</sub>
            * D<sub>2</sub>
            * μ-opioid receptors




* **GIT stimulation**  
    GIT stimuli travel SNS and PNS afferents to the vomiting centre. The CTZ is not involved and so anti-emetics which act here are not useful in this type of vomiting.

    GIT vomiting stimuli include **distension** and **toxins**. Neurotransmitters include:
    * 5-HT<sub>3</sub> in mucosal stretch receptors
    * ACh in NTS afferents
    * H<sub>1</sub> in NTS afferents


###Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting
Central structures involved include:
* Chemoreceptor trigger zone
* NTS
* Multiple pathways exist (similar to those described above), and neurotransmitters involved include:
    * 5-HT<sub>3</sub>
    * D<sub>2</sub>
    * NK<sub>1</sub>
    * H<sub>1</sub>
    * mACh
* Risk factors
    * Patient factors
        * Female
        * Non-Smoker
        * Young age
        * History of PONV or motion sickness
    * Anaesthetic factors
        * Volatile use
        * Nitrous oxide use  
        Relative risk of 1.4.
        * Opioid use
        * Anaesthesia duration
    * Surgical factors
        * Gynaecological surgery  
        Likely not an independent risk factor, and simply confounded by female gender.
        * Strabismus surgery in children

##Process of vomiting
Vomiting consists of a set of processes coordinated by the **vomit centre** in the medulla oblongata, and is divided into three phases:
* **Pre-ejection phase**
    * Prodromal nausea
    * Salivation
    * Retrograde intestinal contraction which forces intestinal contents into the stomach
* **Retching Phase**
    * Deep inspiration and breath-holding to splint the chest
    * Epiglottic closure
    * Elevation of the soft palate (prevents nasal soiling)
* **Expulsive phase**
    * Relaxation of oesophageal sphincters
    * Pyloric contraction
    * Violent contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles
