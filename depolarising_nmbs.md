# Depolarising NMBs {#id}

Succinylcholine binds to the nicotinic ACh receptor causing depolarisation. It cannot be hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase in the NMJ, and so remains bound to the receptor. This:
* Produces a sustained depolarisation which keeps voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive state
* Prevents the post-junctional membrane from responding to further ACh release


|Property|Succinylcholine
|--|--|
|**Class**|Depolarising muscle relaxant.
|**Uses**|Facilitate tracheal intubation.
|**Presentation**|Colourless solution of pH 3, at 50mg.ml<sup>-1</sup>. Structually, it is two ACh groups joined at the acetyl groups.
|**Route of Administration**|IV, IM.
|**Dosing**|1-2mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IV, 3-4mg.kg<sup>-1</sup> IM up to 150mg.
|**Onset and Duration**|IV onset in 30s to 1 minute, lasting 2-3 minutes, with offset typically within 10 minutes. Offset occurs due to dissociation of drug out of NMJ into plasma, as a concentration gradient is established by drug breakdown in plasma. Prolonged duration in patients with **pseudocholinesterase deficiency**. IM onset in 2-3 minues.
|**Distribution**|30% protein bound. Nil distribution due to rapid metabolism - V<sub>D</sub> 0.25L.kg<sup>-1</sup>. Crosses placenta in very small amounts.
|**Metabolism**|Rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases such that only **20%** of administered dose reaches the NMJ.
|**Elimination**|Minimal renal elimination due to rapid metabolism.
|**Resp**|Apnoea, and **suxamethonium apnoea**. May cause **masseter spasm**. ↑ Salivation due to muscarinic effects.
|**CVS**|Arrhythmia due to SA node stimulation, as well as secondary to hyperkalaemia. Bradycardia (due to muscarinic effects with second/large doses, or in children).
|**CNS**|↑ ICP (due to contraction), ↑ IOP (by 10mmHg - this is **significant**) such that it is contraindicated in globe perforation.
|**Metabolic**|**Malignant Hyperthermia**.
|**MSK**|Myalgias post depolarisation, particularly in young females. Prolonged blockade with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
|**Renal and Electrolyte**|Hyperkalaemia (K<sup>+</sup> ↑ by ~0.5mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>) due to depolarisation causing K<sup>+</sup> efflux, ↑ in burns (>10%), paraplegia (first 6 months) and neuromuscular disorders including muscular dystrophy and myopathies (including **critical illness myopathy**).
|**GIT**|Intragastric pressure ↑ by 10cmH<sub>2</sub>O, matched by ↑ in LoS pressure.
|**Immunological**|Anaphylaxis - highest risk of all NMBs.

##Adverse Effects
The adverse effects of suxamethonium can be remembered as **three major, three minor, and three pressures**:
  * **Major**
    * Anaphylaxis
    * Suxamethonium Apnoea
    * Malignant hyperthermia
  * **Minor**
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Myalgias
    * Bradycardia
  * **Pressure**
    * IOP
    * ICP
    * Intragastric pressure

##Phase I and Phase II Blockade
Initial blockade is termed **Phase I**, which is a partial depolarising block. Sustained use of suxamethonium may causes a Phase II block which:
* Appears similar to a non-depolarising block
* May be due to:
  * Presynaptic inhibition of ACh synthesis and release
  * Desensitisation of the postjunctional receptor

Key differences include:

|Property|Phase I Block|Phase II Block
|--|--|--|
|**Block Amplitude**|Reduced|Reduced|
|**Train-of-four ratio**| >0.7|< 0.7
|**Post-tetanic potentiation**|No|Yes
|**Effect of anticholinesterases**|Block augmented|Block inhibited

##Malignant Hyperthermia
* Rare autosomal dominant genetic condition
* Triggered by suxamethonium and volatile anaesthetic agents
* Mutation of the ryanodine receptor causes excessive amounts of calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing continual muscle contraction
  * Results in greatly increased carbon dioxide, lactate, and heat production
  * Cell lysis with myoglobulinaemia and hyperkalaemia results

##Suxamethonium Apnoea
* A deficiency of butylcholinesterase causes suxamethonium to not be metabolsied
* May be congenital (genetic) or acquired (hepatic failure)
* Can be treated with fresh frozen plasma
