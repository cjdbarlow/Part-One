# Erythrocytes {#id}
> Outline the physiological production of blood and its constituents

Erythrocytes:
* Are **7.5μm** in **diameter**  
* Are 2um thick
* Have a lifespan of **120 days**
* Have:
    * No nucleus  
    Maximises cell volume available for Hb.
    * No mitochondria  
    Cannot perform aerobic metabolism - all ATP is generated via glycolysis.
    * No ribosomes
    Incapable of producing protein
* Have a **biconcave disc** shape  
This maximises surface area (optimising gas transfer) and makes the cells flexible enough to pass through capillary beds (which are narrower than the cell).
* Are important in:
    * Delivering O<sub>2</sub> to the tissues and delivering CO<sub>2</sub> to the lungs
    * Acid-Base balance
    * Metabolism of some drugs
* Carry ~29pg of haemoglobin
* Comprise 40-50% of blood volume

##Production
Erythrocytes have a **myeloid progenitor** which differentiates into the myeloid line. EPO (see [endorcrine functions of the kidney](endocrine_functions_of_the_kidney.md#epo) stimulates myeloid progenitor cells to:
  * Differentiate
  * Proliferate

* Proerythroblasts begin synthesis of Hb, with ongoing production occurring until the cell is mature
* Further differentiation results in successive **loss of organelles**, **increasing Hb content**
* The loss of **ribosomes** and **nucleus** of the reticulocyte are the final stage of erythropoiesis
* The entire process takes ~7-10 days


##Function
* Gas Carriage
* Acid-Base Buffering
    * Production of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
    * Binding of H<sup>+</sup> to Hb
* Metabolism  
Esterases (and other -ases) in erythrocytes metabolise many drugs, including:
    * Remifentanil
    * SNP (reacts with Hb to form NO, CN, and Met-Hb)
    * Esmolol

##Elimination
Old red cells are removed from circulation via:
* Phagocytosis by macrophages in:
    * Spleen  
    Major mechanism.
    * Liver
    * Bone marrow
* Haemolysis  
~10% of red cell breakdown occurs in ciruclation, where the Hb dimers are then bound to **haptoglobin** by haemopexin.
    * This is important to prevent glomerular filtration of haeme, and loss of iron

###Haemoglobin Metabolism
**Haemoglobin** is broken down into:
* Globin  
Broken down into constituent amino acids.
* Iron  
Re-enters haemoglobin synthetic pathway.
* Haeme  
Complex metabolic pathway, notable as it is the only metabolic process that produces **carbon monoxide**:
    * Metabolised to **biliverdin** by splenic macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system of the **spleen**
        * Circulating erythrocytes are phagocytosed by splenic macrophages
        * Haptoglobin binds circulating Hb, the Hb-Haptoglobin complex is then phagocytosed by splenic macrophages
    * **Biliverdin** is reduced **to unconjugated bilirubin**  
This is fat soluble, and binds to albumin.
    * **Unconjugated bilirubin** is conjugated in the liver to **conjugated bilirubin**
    * **Conjugated bilirubin** is **secreted in bile** by active transport  
    This is impaired during hepatic disease, leading to increased bilirubin levels in plasma.
    * Secreted **conjugated bilirubin** is metabolised **to urobilinogen** by gut bacteria
    * **Urobilinogen** may have a number of fates:
        * Enterohepatic recirculation and elimination in bile (again)
        * Further metabolism by gut bacteria to **stercobilinogen** and then to **sterobilin**
        * Enterohepatic recirculation and urinary excretion, where it is oxidised to **urobilin**


####In Disease
||Blood|Urine|Faeces|
|--|--|--|
|**Prehepatic disease**|↑ Unconjugated bilirubin| ↑ Urobilinogen, bilirubin not present|Normal|
|**Intrahepatic disease**|↑ Conjugated bilirubin, ↑ Unconjugated bilirubin| Bilirubin present|May be pale due to decreased urobilinogen excreted in bile|
|**Posthepatic disease**|↑ Conjugated bilirubin|↓ Urobilinogen, bilirubin present|Pale|
