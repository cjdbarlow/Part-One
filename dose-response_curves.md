#Dose-Response Curves
>To define and explain dose-effect relationships of drugs, including dose-response curves with reference to: graded and quantal response.

##Standard Dose-Response Curves{#stan}

A dose-response curve is a graph of concentration against the fraction of receptors occupied by a drug.

##Log-Dose Response Curves{#log}
It is difficult to compare drugs using standard dose-response curves. Therefore, dose is commonly log-transformed to produce a log-dose response curve.

This curve:
* Compares log-dose versus clinical effect
* Demonstrates that the blue drug has greater **potency** than the red drug, though both are full agonists

Responses can be either **graded** or **quantal**:
* **Graded responses** demonstrate a **continuous increase** in effect with dose
  * E.g. Blood pressure and noradrenaline dose
* **Quantal responses** demonstrate a response once a certain proportion of receptors are occupied  
Examples include:  
  * ED<sub>95</sub>  
  Median dose of neuromuscular blocker required to produce a 95% loss of twitch height.
  * MAC  
  Mean alveolar concentration of agent required to prevent movement in response to a surgical stimulus.
