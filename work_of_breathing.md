# Work of Breathing
> Describe the work of breathing and its components

Work of breathing is the energy used by the muscles for respiration. It is defined as:  
$$Work = Pressure \times Volume$$, measured in Joules.

* This gives the work for a single respiratory cycle  
Energy expenditure over time is better described as the "power of breathing".
* It does not take into account **respiratory rate** or **flow rate**  
These factors have a significant effect on energy requirement.
  * This would be given by the **rate of work**, or **power**, where:  
  $$Power = {Work \over Time}$$, measured in Watts.
  * Tidal breathing is efficient and uses <2% of BMR
* The oxygen requirement of breathing at rest is ~2-5% of VO<sub>2</sub>, or ~3ml.min<sup>-1</sup>

##Determinants of Work of Breathing
Work of breathing is divided into:
* **Elastic work**  
About 65% of total work, and is stored as elastic potential energy. Energy required to overcome elastic forces:
  * Lung elastic recoil
  * Surface tension of alveoli
* **Resistive work**  
About 35% of total work, and is lost as heat. Energy required to overcome frictional forces:
  * Between tissues
    * Increased with increased interstitial lung tissue
  * Between gas molecules
    * Increased at high flow rates
    * Increased with turbulent flow
      * High respiratory rates
      * Upper airway obstruction
      * Increased airway density
        * Hyperbaric
        * Diving
    * Increased with decreased airway radius 
      * Low lung volume
        * Inadequate PEEP
        * Decreased respiratory muscle tone
      * Bronchoconstriction
      * Dynamic airway compression  
      Effort-independent expiration.
      * Apparatus
        * Endotracheal Tube
        * HME filters
      * Airway resistance varies depending on airway division:
        * Resistance peaks at the 3rd airway division (lobar bronchi)
        * Falls with increasing airway divisions due to increased cross-sectional area

###Graphing Work of Breathing
Work of breathing can be evaluated with a dynamic lung compliance curve:

WORK OF BREATHING LUNG COMPLIANCE CURVE

* If there **were no resistive forces**, then this curve would be a straight line
  * The triangular area is the elastic work done
* The resistive work of brathing causes the deviation of the inspiratory and expiratory lines:
  * The area between the compliance line and the inspiratory line is additional **resistive inspiratory** work done
  * The area between the compliance line and expiratory line is additional **resistive expiratory** work done
    * This work is typically done by elastic recoil of the lungs
    * If this area falls within the area of elastic work of breathing, it is a purely passive process, using the stored elastic potential energy of inspiration
    * If part of this area falls outside the area of elastic work of breathing, it demonstrates additional **active work of expiration** which may occur in obstructive lung disease or when minute ventilation is high

###Minimising Work of Breathing
Work of breathing can be minimised by optimising the determinants:
* Elastic work
  * PEEP  
  Keep lung volume at FRC and maximise number of ventilated alveoli.
  * Positioning  
  Optimise lung volume.
  * Surfactant  
  Minimising surface tension.
  * Optimise respiratory rate  
  Elastic work of breathing typically decreases with increased respiratory rate.
* Resistive work  
  * Decrease respiratory rate  
  Respiratory rate is directly proportional to resistive work.
  * Increase laminar flow  
  Laminar flow is more efficient than turbulent flow. Laminar flow can be increased by:
    * Reducing gas density  
    Heliox.
  * Increase Radius  
    * Increase lung volume
    * Bronchodilators

##Derivation
Work is defined as:   
$$ W = FD $$, where:
* $$W$$ = Work in Joules
* $$F$$ = Force in Newtons
* $$D$$ = Distance in Metres

Additionally, pressure is defined as:  
$$ P = {F \over A}$$, where:
* $$P$$ = Pressure in Pascal
* $$A$$ = Area in Meters squared

Therefore:  
$$F = PA$$  

Substituting:  
$$W = PAD$$  
$$W = PV$$, where:
* $$V$$ = Volume

Therefore:  
$$Work = Pressure \times Volume$$
