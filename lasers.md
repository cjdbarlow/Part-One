A laser is a device for **l**ight **a**mplification by  **s**timulated **e**mission of **r**adiation. Laser light is:
* Non-divegent  
All photons move in parallel.
* Coherent  
All photons are in phase.
* Monochromatic  
All photons have the same wavelength.

Lasers are used clinically for:
* Precise incisions  
Destruction of cells by localised vapourisation of water.
* Destruction of chemicals  
Tattoos, oncological drugs.
* Tissue destruction without heating  
Opthalmology.

##Principles
Method:
* An energy source is passed through a **lasing medium**, housed in a **resonator** made of mirrors
* As the lasing medium is excited, electons enter a higher energy level  
When more than 50% of electrons are at a higher energy level, **population inversion** has occurred.
* As electrons fall back to their resting state, they release a photon
    * A spontaneous emission occurs when an electron enters its resting state spontaneously
    * A stimulated emission occurs when an electron enters its resting state after being struck by a photon released from a spontaneous emission
        * Stimulated emissions result in amplification of light release
* The mirrors in the resonating chamber mean that most light is reflected back into the chamber to cause more stimulated emissions
* The exit from the chamber can be be adjusted so only certain polarities of light are emitted
* A lens may be used to focus the laser beam


* Lasers may be:
    * Pulse wave  
    Uses short bursts of laser light to minimise collateral damage.
    * Continuous wave  
    May lead to excessive heating.
    
##Pros
* Precise surgery and haemostasis

##Cons
* Require multiple safety precautions
    * Laser safety offier
    * Eye protection
    * Warning signs on doors
    * Cover theatre windows
    * Non-combustible drapes
    * Matte finish on equipment to minimise chance of reflection
* Additional risks in airway surgery
    * Use lowest FiO<sub>2</sub> possible
    * Avoid N<sub>2</sub>O
    * Consider use of heliox
    * Use specialised laser tubes  
    Normal PVC ETTs are combustible.
