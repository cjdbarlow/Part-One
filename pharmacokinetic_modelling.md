>Explain the concept of pharmacokinetic modeling of single and multiple compartment models.

**Pharmacokinetics** describes what the body does to a drug. Pharmacokinetic models are mathematical concepts used to predict plasma concentrations of drugs at different time points.

##Basic Pharmacokinetic Terms
Key concepts in pharmacokinetics include:
* **Volume of distribution, V<sub>D</sub>**  
The volume of distribution is defined as the **theoretical volume into which an amount of drug would be distribute to produce the observed plasma concentration**.
    * Units are ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> 
        * $$ Vd = {Total \ bioavailable \ drug \over Plasma \ concentration } $$ 
    * It is a way to describe what proportion of a drug is confined to plasma, and what proportion distributes to other tissues
    * It does not correspond to any particular volume, however a V<sub>D</sub> of:
        * Less than 40ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> indicates a drug is confined to plasma
        * Up to 200ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> indicates a drug is confined to the ECF
        * Up to 600ml.kg<sup>-1</sup> indicates a drug is dissolved into the TBW
        * Greater than 1L.kg<sup>-1</sup> indicates a drug is highly protein bound or lipophilic  
        Agents which cross the blood brain barrier typically have a V<sub>D</sub> of 1-2L.kg<sup>-1</sup>.
    * Subtypes of the volume of distribution are used to describe drug distribution at different times or with different models
        * These include:
            * V<sub>1</sub>  
            Volume of central compartment.
            * V<sub>D</sub>ss  
            Volume of distribution at steady state.
            * V<sub>D</sub>pe  
            Volume of distribution at peak effect.
        * Which volume to use depends on the pharmacological question
            * e.g. Intubating dose for opioid should use a volume between V<sub>1</sub> (very small) and V<sub>D</sub>ss (very large) - V<sub>D</sub>pe is ideal as it will allow a target concentration to be selected for the time at which intubation will occur relative to drug administration


* **Half-life** (t<sub>1/2</sub>)  
The time it takes for a process to be 50% complete. With respect to drug clearance, it is the time it takes for concentration (typically in plasma) to fall by 50%.
    * A process is considered to be complete after 4-5 half-lives  
    Concentration will decrease by 50% after each half-life, so after 5 half-lives concentration will be 3.125% of its starting value.
        * This also applies to wash in - it will take ~4-5 elimination half-lives of a drug for a constant-rate infusion to reach its final concentration
    * Half-life is mathematically related to many other key pharmacokinetic terms:  
    $$t_{1/2} = 0.693 \times \tau = {0.693 \over k} = {0.693 \times V_D \over Cl}$$, where:
        * $$\tau$$ is the time constant
        * $$k$$ is the rate constant for elimination
        * $$V_D$$ is the volume of distribution
        * $$Cl$$ is the clearance
    * Various types of half-life are described:
        * t<sub>1/2</sub>α describes the rapidity of the distribution phase following drug administration
        * t<sub>1/2</sub>β describes the rapidity of the *elimination* phase occurring after drug distribution equilibrium  
        This only evaluates clearance from plasma, and so is a composite of both excretion from the body (e.g. renal and hepatic clearance) and ongoing distribution to peripheral tissues.
            * The elimination half-life is generally not useful to predict drug offset, as this is affected by many factors  
            However, it does set an **upper limit** on how long it will take plasma concentration to fall by 50%.


* **Time-constant** ($$\tau$$)  
The time taken for a process to complete if it continued at its initial rate of change. Time constants are related to half-life, but are better suited when modeling change in exponential processes.
    * Time constants are discussed in more detail under [respiratory time constants](time-constants.md)
    * Elimination will be virtually complete after three time constants
    * A time constant is the **inverse of the rate constant for elimination**, i.e. $$ \tau = {1 \over k }$$
    * Illustration of the relationship between half-life and time constant:  
    <img src="\resources\half-life-and-time-constants.svg">  


* **Clearance**  
The clearance is volume of plasma completely cleared of a drug per unit time.
    * In a one compartment model, this can be expressed as: $$ Cl = k.V_D $$ in ml.min<sup>-1</sup>.
        * As the **time constant** is the inverse of **k**, clearance can also be expressed as: $$ Cl = {V_D \over \tau } = {0.693 \times V_D \over t_{1/2}} $$
    * Since $$k$$ and $$V_D$$ are constants, clearance is also a constant
    * Total clearance is a sum of the clearance of each individual clearance organ


* **Rate of elimination**  
Amount of drug removed by the body per unit time.
    * Rate of elimination is the product of the clearance and the current concentration: $$ Rate \ of \ Elimination = Cl \times C $$, in mg.min<sup>-1</sup>
    * This is not the rate constant for elimination


##Compartmental Modeling{#one}
The simplest model imagines the body a single, well-stirred compartment. 

<img src="\resources\1compartment.svg" style="width: 10pc;">

In a one compartment model, the concentration of a drug ($$C$$) at time $$t$$ is given by the equation:

$$ C = C_0 e^{-kt} $$

Where:
* $$C_0$$ is the concentration at time 0  
As drug can only be eliminated from the compartment, this is also the peak concentration.
* **k** is the **rate constant for elimination**  
This is the fraction of the Vd from which the drug is removed per unit time. The rate constant **determines** the **slope** of the curve.
    * A high rate constant for elimination results in a steep curve and therefore a short time constant


###Steady state
At steady state, **input is equal to output**. Therefore concentration at steady state is:
* Proportional to the concentration of the infusion and infusion rate
* Inversely proportional to the clearance:  
$$ \begin{aligned}
Input = Output \\  
C_i.I = C_{ss}.Cl \\
C_{ss} = {C_i.I \over Cl}
\end{aligned}$$
    * Concentration of drug can therefore be determined by the amount infused and the clearance
* Note steady state requires peripheral compartments to be saturated, and so will only occur after an infusion of many hours

###Multiple Compartment Models{#multi}
* Models with multiple compartments have a better fit with experimental data than single compartment models
* Three-compartment models are typically used, as additional compartments typically offer no extra fidelity but are mathematically more complex
* A three-compartment model *can* be conceptualised as a plasma (or central) compartment, a well-perfused compartment, and a poorly-perfused compartment  
This doesn't mean that they *should* be thought of in this way - they are a mathematical technique used to calculate plasma concentration at a given time.

Plasma concentration in multi-compartment models is:
* Predicted through the net effect of several negative exponential equations  x
This is covered under two-compartment models below.
* Dependent on the effects of:
    * **Distribution**   
    Distribution describes the movement of drug from the central compartment (V<sub>1</sub>) to the peripheral compartment(s).
        * Rapid fall in plasma concentration of a drug after administration is generally due to distribution  
        Distribution is an important method for drug offset in short-acting drugs.
    * **Redistribution**  
    Redistribution refers to the movement of drug from the peripheral compartment(s) back into plasma.
        * Drugs which have a large V<sub>D</sub> in a peripheral compartment tend to **distribute quickly** along this concentration gradient, and **redistribute slowly** back into plasma
        * Drugs which tend to **distribute slowly** tend to **redistribute quickly** once administration has ceased
    * **Excretion**  
    Excretion is the removal of drug from the body. 

####Clearance in Two-Compartment Models{#bi}
Removal of drug in two-compartment models is via:
* Distribution from the central to the peripheral compartment
* Elimination from the central compartment
* This produces a **bi-exponential** fall in plasma concentration  
Consists of two phases:
    * Phase α  
    Distribution phase: A rapid decline in plasma concentration due to distribution to peripheral tissues.
    * Phase β  
    Elimination phase: Slow decline in plasma concentration due to:
        * Elimination from the body
        * Redistribution into plasma

This curve is given by the equation $$C = Ae^{-\alpha t} + Be^{-\beta t}$$, where:
* $$C$$ is the concentration of drug in plasma
* $$A$$ is the y-intercept of the distribution exponent  
Used to calculate distribution half-life.
* $$B$$ is the y-intercept of the elimination exponent  
Used to calculate elimination half-life.
* $$\alpha$$ is the rate constant for distribution  
The value of $$\alpha$$ is dependent on the ratio of rate constants for distribution and redistribution (i.e. $$k_{12} \over k_{21}$$).
    * If distribution greatly exceeds redistribution, the gradient of $$\alpha$$ will be very steep and plasma concentration will fall rapidly after administration
* $$\beta$$ is the rate constant for elimination  


* Note that the distribution and elimination curves appear straight because the y-axis is log-transformed
    * If plasma concentration was plotted on the y-axis, then each of these curves would be a negative exponential (wash-out curve)
    
    
####Effect Site{#effect}
Pharmacokinetic models typically display the plasma concentration.
* Clinically however, we are interested in drug concentrations at the site of action (e.g. the brain)
    * Concentration at the effect site (also known as biophase) is given by **Ce**
        * This cannot be measured, and so is a calculated value
    * Effect site concentration be different from plasma concentration (**Cp**) prior to reaching steady state  
    The delay between plasma and effect site concentrations is an example of hysteresis.
* The effect site can be modeled as an additional compartment in three-compartment models  
The effect site is modeled as a **compartment of negligible volume** contained **within V<sub>1</sub>**, but does have rate constants
    * Effect site volume changes as V<sub>1</sub> changes
    * The k<sub>1e</sub> is the rate constant for drug diffusion from plasma into the effect site
    * The **k<sub>e0</sub>** is the rate constant for elimination of drug **from the effect site**  
    This is a theoretical elimination pathway - drug is not usually metabolised at the effect site.
        * The t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0 describes the effect-site equilibration time  
        It describes how rapidly the effect site reaches equilibrium with plasma.
            * A large ke0 (rapid drug flow) gives a short t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0
            * After one t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0, 50% of the final effect site concentration will be reached provided plasma concentration remains constant
        * **A shorter t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0 indicates that that the effect site concentration will reach equilibrium with plasma more rapidly, and therefore a more rapid clinical effect following administration is seen**
        * Note that:
            * The t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0 is not the time to peak effect
                * Neither is k<sub>e0</sub>
            * For an infusion run at constant plasma concentration the peak effect will be seen at 3-5x the t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0
            * The time to peak effect is a function of both plasma kinetics and the t<sub>1/2</sub>ke0
                * e.g. adenosine has such a short elimination t<sub>1/2<sub> the effect site concentration will reach its peak rapidly regardless of the k<sub>e0</sub>

##Non-Compartmental Models
Compartment models are not appropriate for describing the behaviours of all drugs. Non-compartmental models are used when drug:
* Clearance is organ-independent
* Elimination does not occur solely from the central compartment

These models use **AUC**, which is calculated by measuring the plasma concentration of a drug at different time intervals, and **plotting the area under the curve (AUC)**. This can be used to:
* Determine **clearance**  
$$ Cl = {Dose \over AUC}$$
* Determine **Bioavailability**  
Difference between the AUC of the same dose of drug administered IV and via another route.

##Footnotes
The formula for half-life can be derived from the equation for a wash-in exponential as follows:
* Wash in exponential is given by: $$C = 1 - e^{-kt}$$  
* $$y = 0.5$$ can then be substituted and the equation solved for $$t$$ as follows:  
$$ \begin{aligned}
0.5 &= 1 - e^{-kt} \\
 -0.5 &= e^{-kt} \\
\ln-0.5 &= -kt \\
\ln 2 &= kt \\
{\ln 2 \over k} &= t \\
{0.693 \over k} &= t

\end{aligned}$$
