Change in lung volume occurs due to change in pressures. Respiration relies on the thoracic cavity being **airtight**, with the trachea being the only method gas can enter or exit the chest.

##Intrapleural pressure (P<sub>pl</sub>)  
**Intrapleural pressure** is the pressure in the space between the visceral and parietal pleura, or (physiologically) between the lungs and the chest wall.
* Usually **negative**, typically **5cmH<sub>2</sub>O at rest**)
  * Outwards recoil of the chest wall
  * Inwards recoil of the lungs (**P<sub>el</sub>**)
* Varies with vertical distance in the lung  
  * Gravity pulls the lung parenchyma inferiorly
  * Intrapleural pressure is therefore:
    *  **More negative** in the **apex**  
    Typically **-10cmH<sub>2</sub>O** at FRC
    * **Less negative** in the **base**  
    Typically **-3cmH<sub>2</sub>O** at FRC
* This changes the degree of inflation at FRC
  * Apical alveoli are maximally inflated
  * Basal alveoli are hardly inflated
* During inspiration, the pleural pressure changes evenly throughout the lung, however the basal alveoli are better ventilated because they have greater compliance


##Inspiration
* Diaphragmatic and external intercostal/accessory muscle contraction causes an increase in the volume of the thorax
* Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, typically to **-8cmH<sub>2</sub>O**
* When P<sub>pl</sub> > P<sub>el</sub>, the lungs expands
* Alveolar pressure (P<sub>A</sub>) becomes subatmospheric, and inspiration occurs
* At end inspiration:
  * P<sub>pl</sub> = P<sub>el</sub>
  * P<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>atmospheric</sub>
 

##Expiration
* Muscular relaxation causes the chest wall to passively return to their resting position
* Thoracic volume falls
* P<sub>pl</sub> falls to -5cmH<sub>2</sub>O
* The elastic recoil of the lung causes it to collapse until P<sub>A</sub> = P<sub>atmospheric</sub>
