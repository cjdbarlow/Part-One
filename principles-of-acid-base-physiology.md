#Principles of Acid-Base Physiology {#id}
> Explain the principles underlying acid-base chemistry

There have been several different theories of acid-base chemistry. The one most relevant for the primary exam is the **Brønsted–Lowry definition**, which defines:
* An **acid** as a **proton donor**
* A **base** as a **proton acceptor**

##pH
* Stands for the **power of hydrogen**
* Is a measure of **hydrogen ion activity** in a solution
 * Activity can be approximated by concentration
 * Therefore, pH can be expressed as a function of hydrogen ion concentration:  $$pH = -log_{10}[H^+]$$  
 Using pH rather than concentration makes it easier to compare different solutions.
  
##pKa{#pka}
* Strong acids (and bases) dissociate completely in solution
* Weak acids (and bases) only partially dissociate  
They have a dissociated state (A-) and an undissociate state (HA)
* The ratio of concentrations on each side can be used to calculate the **acid dissociation constant**, **Ka**  
$$ Ka = {[A^-] \times [H^+] \over [HA]}$$  
This equation describes the strength of an acid by indicating how readily the acid gives up its hydrogen.
* Similar to pH, this value is often log transformed to **pKa** produce an index, which allows easy comparison of different substances:  
$$ pKa = -log_{10}Ka$$  
* pKa has several useful properties:
 * An acid of base will be 50% ionised when the pH of its solution equals its pKa
  * **A**cids are more **i**onised **a**bove their pKa
  * **B**ases are more **i**onised **b**elow their pKa
 * An increase in pH of 1 above the pKa will result in that substance being either 90% (for an acid) or 10 % (for a base) ionised

##Systemic Effects of Acid-Base Disorders
pH disturbance affects many organ systems:
* **Respiratory**
 * Increased $$\dot{V}_A$$  
 Peripheral and central chemoreceptors increase ventilation in response to a fall in pH.
 * Oxyhaemoglobin-Dissociation Curve  
 Right-shifted by a fall in pH.
 * Bronchoconstriction  
 Hypercapnoea causes parasympathetically-mediated bronchoconstriction.
* **Cardiovascular**
 * Inotropy  
  Inotropy falls in acidosis due to a direct myocardial depressant effect. May be offset by increased SNS tone in low-grade acidosis. Alkalosis may increase inotropy by increasing responsiveness to circulating catecholamines.
 * Decreased response to catecholamines  
 When pH < 7.2.
 * Arrhythmias  
 Secondary to altered SNS tone and electrolytes.
 * Vasodilation  
 Directly due to hypercapnoea.
* **CNS**  
H<sup>+</sup> ions cannot cross the BBB, however CO<sub>2</sub> can.
* **Fluid and Electrolyte**  
 * Plasma **K<sup>+</sup> increases **by** 0.6mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> for every 0.1 unit fall** in **pH**  
 This is due to impairment of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase
 * **H<sup>+</sup> ions bind **to the **same site on albumin as calcium**, so ionised calcium will **increase**
* **MSK**
 * Bones  
 Chronic metabolic acidosis consumes bone phosphate to buffer H<sup>+</sup> ions, causing osteoporosis.
* **Cellular**
 * Enzyme function  
 Denaturation and functional impairment.
 * Molecular ionisation  
 Change in ionisation may change a molecules ability to cross cell membranes (e.g. reducing dose of thiopentone in acidosis), or affect their function
 * Resting membrane potential  
 Change in ion permeability will alter RMP, and therefore how easy it is to generate an action potential.
 
###Change with Temperature
pH is temperature dependant:
* **pH increases** by **0.015** for every **1°C fall** in **temperature**  
Due to decreased ionic dissociation of water.
* **Gas solubility **almost always** increases** when **temperature falls**  
Dissolving is typically (not always) an **exothermic** reaction. As the kinetic energy content of a molecule falls, its ability to dissociate from solution decreases.
 * As CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves, PaCO<sub>2</sub> falls
* As blood gas machines operate at 37°C, a measurement error will occur if a patient is  not close to 37°C
 * A **hypothermic** patient will have a **higher pH** and **CO<sub>2</sub>** than measured

There are two common methods for **managing** pH of significantly hypothermic patients (e.g., those on CPB): **pH-stat** and **alpha-stat**.

####pH-stat
* CO<sub>2</sub> is added to the circuit so that pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub> are normal when corrected for temperature
* This theoretically improves oxygen delivery by preventing the left-shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve
* The increased CO<sub>2</sub> also causes cerebral vasodilation, which:
 * Increases speed and uniformity of cerebral cooling
 * Increases risk of cerebral embolic events

####alpha-stat
* pH and CO<sub>2</sub> values are maintained at 'normal for 37°C'
 * Measured values will be different, as:
   * pH will be increased
   * CO<sub>2</sub> will be decreased
* Cellular autoregulation is preserved
* Unlike pH-stat, this does not cause cerebral vasodilation
