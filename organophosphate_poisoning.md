# Organophosphate Poisoning

Organophosphates are substances bind **irreversibly** to **acetylcholinestersase**, causing cholinergic excess. Examples include fertilisers and sarin gas.


##Toxicity
Effects (as expected) are signs of muscarininc and nicotinic overactivation. This can be remembered by 'BLUDGES' for the muscarinic effects:
* **B**radycardia (and subsequent hypotension)
* **L**acrimation
* **U**rination
* **D**efecation
* **G**IT upset
* **E**mesis
* **S**weating and **S**alivation

and 'M' for the nicotinic effects:
* **M**uscular spasm

##Management
Management is aimed at reducing ACh burden:
* **Atropine**  
Competitive antagonises ACh at the muscarinic receptor.
    * Atropine is preferred over glycopyrrolate as it will cross the blood brain barrier and treat central ACh toxicity
* **Pralidoxime**  
Reactivates acetylcholinesterase by luring the organophosphate away from the enzyme with a tantalising oxime group.
    * Pralidoxime must be used within the first few hours of poisoning  
    Aafter which the organophosphate-enzyme group 'ages' and is no longer susceptible.
    * Does not cross the blood-brain barrier and so cannot treat central effects
