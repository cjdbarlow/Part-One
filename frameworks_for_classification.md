#Structures for SAQs
Structured answers are vital:
* Structure aids both learning and recall of information
* A structured format is easy to follow less likely to irritate the drunk/tired/hungover mind of the examiner
* You may get marks for incomplete answers if your structure demonstrates you have an understanding of the topic, even if the details are not filled in

Some questions lend themselves more easily to a particular structure than others, but all questions can be made to fit even a basic structure.
