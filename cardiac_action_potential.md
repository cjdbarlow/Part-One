An action potential is a propagating change in the membrane potential of an excitable cell, used in cellular communication and to initiate intracellular processes. It is caused by altering the permeability of a membrane to different ions.

##Pacemaker Potential{#pace}
This pattern of electrical activity is seen in the SA and AV nodes. It  **has no resting state**, and is continually depolarising.

###Phases of the Pacemaker Potential{#pacephase}

<img src="resources\pacemaker-phases.svg">

* **Phase 0**  
  At the threshold potential of **-40mV**, voltage-gated L-type (long-lasting) Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open, causing an inward movement of ions. The membrane potential peaks at **20mV**.
* **Phase 3**  
  Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels close and K<sup>+</sup> channels open, leading to repolarisation. The nadir is called the **maximum diastolic potential** and is -**65mV**.
* **Phase 4**  
  Phase 4 consists of:
    * The **funny current**  
    A steady influx of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> which gradually depolarises the cell.
      * Sympathetic stimulation increases the funny current, increasing the rate of depolarisation.
      * Parasympathetic stimulation increases K<sup>+</sup> permeability, hyperpolarising the cell and flattens the gradient of phase 4.
    * Calcium current  
    In phase 4, this is the transient calcium current, driven by T-type calcium channels. They open when the membrane potential reaches ~-50mV, also causing depolarisation.

##Ventricular Action Potential{#vent}
To prevent tetanic contraction (which would be bad) ventricular muscle has a long plateau prior to repolarisation, which lengthens the absolute refractory period to 250ms. The relative refractory period is 50ms.

###Phases of the Ventricular Action Potential
* **Phase 0**: Depolarisation  
  At the threshold potential, voltage-gated **fast-Na<sup>+</sup>** channels open briefly, causing depolarisation. The membrane potential peaks at **30mV**.
* **Phase 1**: Partial Repolarisation  
  The closure of Na<sup>+</sup> channels results in K<sup>+</sup> fleeing the cell down its electrochemical gradient, causing a slight drop in voltage called partial repolarisation.
* **Phase 2**: Plateau  
  **L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels** open, causing a slow inward Ca<sup>2+</sup> current which maintains depolarisation and facilitates muscle contraction.
* **Phase 3**: Repolarisation  
  Membrane permeability normalises, and outward potassium current returns the membrane potential to normal.
* **Phase 4**: Resting Potential  
  Membrane potential returns to its resting **-85mV**.

##Propagation of the Cardiac Action Potential
Pacemaker cells:
* Are responsible for automaticity and rhythmicity of the heart
* The fastest pacemaker is the focus for myocardial conduction  
This is typically the SA node.
  * Should the SA node fail, the next fastest pacemaker will take over
  * This provides an element of redundancy

Conduction pathway:
* **Atrial Conduction**  
  From the SA node, the impulse travels at ~1m.s<sup>-1</sup>, depolarising the atria.
  * Current travels down **Bachmann's Bundle**, which connects the right atrium to the left atrium


* **AV node**  
  The AV node is the only (normal) site of connection between the atria and ventricles. AV nodal cells:
  * Transmits with a delay of 0.1s  
  This allows time for atrial contraction to finish before ventricular contraction begins.
  * Have a prolonged refractory period and cannot conduct more than **220** impulses per minute
    * This period is prolonged by vagal stimulation, which increases potassium permeability and hyperpolarises the cell
    * Conversely, sympathetic stimulation increases calcium permeability and allows more rapid transmission
  * Conducts via three pathways:
    * Bachmann Pathway  
    Also conducts to the LA.
    * Wenckebach pathway
    * Thorel pathway


* **Ventricular Conduction**  
  From the AV node, the signal propagates:
  * Initially via the **Bundle of His** to the right and left bundles
  * Secondly via the **Purkinje fibres** which conduct at 1-4m.s<sup>-1</sup>  
  Purkinje fibres have a long refractory period, and spontaneously depolarise with an intrinsic rate of 30-40 bpm.
  * Lastly, ventricular muscle is depolarised  
  Endocardium, papillary muscle and septum contract first, followed by apex, followed by the chambers.


##Autonomic Control
* **Parasympathetic Innervation**  
    * SA node by the right vagus  
    There is continual PNS input ("Vagal tone") via inhibitory ACh GPCR, reducing the SA node from its intrinsic rate of 90-120bpm to a more sedate 60-100bpm.
    * AV node by the left vagus
    * The atria are innervated by parasympathetic neurons, whilst the ventricles are only minimally innervated  
    PNS stimulation therefore has little effect on inotropy, but does affect chronotropy.
      * PNS stimulation may have no direct effect on inotropy, instead acting indirectly via changes in chronotropy


* **Sympathetic Innervation**  
    * SNS activity causes release of noradrenaline (at post-ganglionic synapse) and adrenaline from adrenal medulla which stimulate cardiac β<sub>1</sub> receptors causing:
        * Positive chronotropy at the SA node
        * Positive inotropy at ventricular muscle
        * Positive luisotropy
        * Shorter action potential duration (due to opening of rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels
        * Increased AV conduction

###Cardiac Transplant
The transplanted heart has no vagal/parasympathetic innervation but still expresses β<sub>1</sub> receptors, so it:
* Defaults to a resting heart rate of ~100bpm
* Becomes highly preload dependent as it cannot respond quickly to changes in SVR
* Not responsive to parasympatholytics (atropine, glycopyrrolate) or ephedrine (as this is indirectly-acting) to increase chronotropy - isoprenaline may be used
* Gradual response to demands in exercise (lacks local SNS innervation, but will still respond to circulating catecholamines)
* Increased sensitivity to catecholamines due to increased expression of β<sub>1</sub> receptors
