##Vascular Anatomy
###Coronary Artery Anatomy

The **left main** coronary artery:
* Arises from the posterior aortic sinus superior to the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve  
Eddy currents produced the **sinuses of Valsalva** (out-pouchings of the aortic wall) prevent the valves occluding the os of the LM and RCA during systole, so they remain patent throughout the cardiac cycle.
* The **left main** is 5-10mm long, and bifurcates to form the LAD and LCx

The **LAD**:
* Courses along the **anterior interventricular groove** to the apex of the heart  
Here, it anastomoses with the posterior descending artery from the RCA.
* **Supplies** the **anterolateral myocardium** and **anterior 2/3** of the interventricular **septum**
* **Branches** of the LAD include:
  * **Diagonal** vessels  
  Branches are named successively from proximal to distal, i.e. LADD<sub>1</sub>, LADD<sub>2</sub>, etc.
  * **Septal perforators**

The **LCx**:
* Courses along the **left antrioventricular** groove between the LA and LV in the epicardial fat pad
* **Supplies** the **inferolateral wall** of the **LV**
* Gives off three **obtuse marginal** branches (OM<sub>1</sub>, OM<sub>2</sub>) which follow the left margin of the heart
* Runs in close approximation with the coronary sinus for much of its course

The **RCA**:
* Arises from the anterior aortic sinus, superior to the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve
* Courses vertically downwards in the **right atrioventricular groove**
* Supplies the RA and RV

The **posterior descending artery**:
* Arises from either the LCx or RCA  
These vessels travel in opposite directions around the atrioventricular groove.
* Descends in the posterior interventricular groove before coursing along the base to anastomose with the LAD at the apex of the heart
* Is also known as the posterior interventricular artery



####Coronary Dominance
Coronary dominance refers to which vessel gives rise to the PDA:
* In a **right-dominant** circulation the PDA is supplied by the **RCA**
* In a **left-dominant** circulation the PDA is supplied by the **LCx**

Additionally:
* The **SA node** is supplied by the **RCA in 60%** of individuals
* The **AV node** is supplied by the **RCA in 90%** of individuals

###Venous Anatomy
* 85% of venous drainage occurs via the **coronary sinus**, which is formed from the cardiac veins:
  * The **great cardiac vein** runs with the LAD
  * The **middle cardiac vein** follows the PDA
  * The **small cardiac vein** runs with the RCA
  * The **oblique vein** follows the posterior part of the LA
* Most of the remainder is via **anterior cardiac veins** which drain directly into the RA
* A small proportion of blood from the left side of the heart is drained via the **thebesian veins** directly into the cardiac chambers

##Coronary Blood Flow
Coronary Blood Flow:
* Normal is **~250ml.min<sup>-1</sup>** (~5% of resting CO)
* May increase 4x during strenuous exercise  
Myocardial *work* may increase up to 9x, though as myocardial oxygen extraction is unchanged efficiency is actually improved during exercise.

CBF is dependent on:
* Coronary vascular resistance
* Coronary perfusion pressure  
The difference between aortic root pressure and the greater of RAP or intracavity pressure: i.e. $$ CBF = {P_{Aorta} - P_{Cavity} \ or \ RAP \over CVR } $$
  * Note that the pressure gradient is usually Aorta-Cavity rather than Aorta-RA  
  This is because the pressure in the ventricle acts as a Starling resistor - coronary flow is independent of RAP whilst $$RAP < P_{Cavity}$$
* Heart rate  
CBF is affeted in systole due to the changes in perfusion pressure, and compression of intramuscular vessels (causing an increase in CVR).
  * RV CBF is less affected, as the force of contraction is significantly smaller and a pressure gradient is maintained
  * Tachycardia reduces diastolic time and subsequently LV CBF

###Control of Coronary Blood Flow
CBF is **autoregulated**:
* **Myogenic autoregulation**  
  This is common to many organ systems, and occurs within the coronaries.
  * Increasing transmural pressure increases the leakiness of smooth muscle membranes, depolarising them
  * Resistance increases proportionally to pressure, such that flow remains constant
* **Metabolic autoregulation**  
Anaerobic metabolism results in production of vasoactive mediates such as **lactate** and **adenosine**, which stimulate vasodilation and therefore increase flow (and oxygen delivery).
  * This is the predominant means for autoregulation in the heart
  * Typical **myocardial oxygen extraction is 70%** and raising this further is difficult  
  Therefore, increasing oxygen supply requires an increase in blood flow.



**Autonomic** mechanisms also control some aspects of coronary blood flow:  
* **Direct** effects include:
  * Parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of coronary vessels, with release of ACh or NA and A decreasing or increasing coronary blood flow
*  **Indirect** effects
  *  Are more important than direct effects
  *  Are related to autoregulation occurring with changing levels of myocardial work in response to parasympathetic or sympathetic stimuli
