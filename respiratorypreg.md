#Respiratory Changes of Pregnancy
> Explain the physiological changes during pregnancy, and parturition

Respiratory changes in pregnancy are a function of two things:
* Anatomical compression of the chest
* Increased VO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub>

##Anatomical Changes
* Diaphragm pushed upwards by ~**4cm**
* Increased AP and transverse diameter of the chest wall (~2-3cm)
* Large airway dilation, reducing airway resistance by ~35%

##Volumes and Capacities
From conception until term:
* V<sub>T</sub> increases by 40%
* Inspiratory capacity increases by 10%
* Expiratory capacity decreases by 30%
* Total lung capacity decreases by 5%
* Vital capacity is unchanged
 
From ~20 weeks until term:
* ERV decreases
* RV decreases
* FRC decreases
    * By 20% erect
    * By 30% supine

##Ventilation
**Progesterone** stimulates respiratory centres, shifting the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> response curves to the left which causes hyperventilation and a **respiratory alkalosis**. From conception until term:
* MV increases by 50%
    * 10% increase in RR
    * 40% increase in V<sub>T</sub>
* PCO<sub>2</sub> falls to ~26-32mmHg, with a compensatory drop in plasma [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] to 18-21mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>


##Labour and Postpartum
During labour:
* MV increases 70% due to pain and increased oxygen demand
* This causes hypocapnoea, so cessation of uterine contractions (and the associated pain and oxygen demand) are followed by a hypoventilatory period producing desaturation

FRC and RV return to normal within 48 hours of delivery.
