# Oxygen Cascade {#id}
> Describe and explain the oxygen cascade

The **oxygen cascade** describes the transfer of oxygen from air to mitochondria.
* In each step of the cascade the PaO<sub>2</sub> falls  
It demonstrates that oxygen delivery to tissues relies on the **passive transfer** of gas down **partial pressure gradients**.
* The steps of the cascade are:
  * Dry atmospheric gas
  * Humidified tracheal gas
  * Alveolar gas
  * Arterial blood
  * Mitochondria
  * Venous blood
  

* Oxygen **content** is what is important for cellular function
* **Partial pressure** determines rate and extent of gas transfer

##Atmospheric Gas
Atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen is a function of barometric pressure and the FiO<sub>2</sub>:  
$$PO_2 = P_B \times FiO_2$$, where:
* $$P_B$$ is 760mmHg
* $$FiO_2$$ is 0.21

* Therefore, $$PO_2$$ = **160mmHg**

##Humidified Tracheal Gas
* Gas is humidified during inspiration
* Gas in the proximal trachea is **heated to 37°C** and has **100% relative humidity**
* The **saturated vapour pressure** of water at 37°C is **47mmHg**
* Therefore:  
$$PO_2 = (P_B - P_{SVP \ of \ Water}) \times FiO_2$$, where:
  * $$P_B$$ and $$FiO_2$$ are unchanged


* Therefore, $$PO_2$$ is **149mmHg**


##Alveolar Gas
**Ideal alveolar PO<sub>2</sub>** is calculated using the **alveolar gas equation**:  
$$P_AO_2 = P_iO_2 - {P_aCO_2 \over R} $$, where:
  * $$P_AO_2$$ is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
  * $$P_iO_2$$ is the inspired partial pressure of oxygen
  * $$P_aCO_2$$ is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
  * $$R$$ is the respiratory quotient, where $$R = {Volume \ of \ CO_2 \ produced \over Volume \ of \ O_2 \ consumed}$$   
  R is dependent on the metabolic substrates used for metabolism.
    * Pure fat ≈ 0.7
    * Pure protein ≈ 0.9
    * Pure carbonhydrate ≈ 1
    * The normal value for a Western diet is quoted as **0.8**

Alveolar oxgygen is therefore dependent on:
  * PiO<sub>2</sub>, which is a function of:
    * FiO<sub>2</sub>
    * Air pressure
  * Alveolar ventilation  
  As $$P_aO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$$.

##Arterial Blood
The difference in partial pressure of oxygen between alveolar and arterial blood is called the **A-a gradient**:
$$A-a \ gradient = PAO_2 - PaO_2 = PiO_2 - {PaCO_2 \over R}  - PaO_2 $$
  * A normal A-a gradient is $${Age \over 4} + 4$$  
  * Normal arterial PO<sub>2</sub> is 100mmHg
  * It occurs due to:
    * Shunt/VQ scatter  
    A small shunt is normal due to blood from the bronchial circulation and thebesian veins.
    * Diffusion abnormality
 
##Mitochondria
* PO<sub>2</sub> varies with metabolic activity, but typically quoted as 5mmHg
* The **Pasteur point** is the partial pressure of oxygen at which oxidative phosphorylation ceases, and is **~1mmHg**

##Venous Blood
* PO<sub>2</sub> is greater than mitochondrial PO<sub>2</sub>  
Mixed venous blood typically quoted as 40mmHg.
* Higher than mitochondria as not all arterial blood travels through capillary beds
