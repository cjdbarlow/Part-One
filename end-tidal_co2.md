#End-Tidal Gas Analysis
> Describe the principles of ~~pulse and tissue oximetry, co-oximetry and~~ capnography, including calibration, sources of errors and limitations 

##Principles
Several mechanisms for E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> measurement exist:
* Infrared Spectroscopy
* Colourimetric Methods
* Rayman Scattering
* Gas Chromatography

##Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopy relies on the fact that:
* Gases with two or more different atoms will **absorb infrared radiation**
* **Different gases absorb different wavelengths** to different degrees
* Measuring the absorbed wavelengths and comparing with the **likely composition** of a mixture, a system can be designed using a specific wavelength to measure gas concentrations and avoid interference


End-tidal gas analysis using infrared light is used in the measurement of:
* CO<sub>2</sub>  
Capnography is the continuous measurement and graphical display of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in expired gas. This is the most common method to measure E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>. 
* Anaesthetic agents

##Measurement of CO<sub>2</sub>
Components:
* Sapphire sampling chamber containing gas sample  
    * CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs infrared radiation at a peak wavelength of 4.28μm
    * The sapphire lens only allows 4.28μm light through
* Emitter
* Detector
* Microprocessor
* Display


Method:
* Light is emitted and passes through the sampling chamber  
A lens is used to focus emitted light.
* Levels of radiation are measured on the other side of the chamber  
* Levels correspond to the amount of gas present in the sample
* The less radiation that reaches the detector, the more gas there is in the sample absorbing it

###Equipment Errors
Errors can be classified into:
* Specific to technique
    * The **collision broadening effect**  
    Intermolecular forces vary depending on their proximity to other molecules in the gas mixture. A change in intermolecular forces may alter their bond-energy and the frequencies at which they absorb radiation. It can be overcome by:
        * Correcting for the presence of other gases
        * Manually adjusting the obtained values
    * Crossover with other gas mixtures  
    CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O have similar absorbance spectra, and may lead to error when a device is not designed to measure both wavelengths.


* Failure of equipment  
These can be overcome by use of **double-beam capnometer**. This uses a reference chamber which contains CO<sub>2</sub>-free air, and the same emitter-detector system. All absorption from this system must occur due to artefact (as no CO<sub>2</sub> is present). The artefactual component is then subtracted from the value detected in the main chamber. This corrects for:
    * Variable amount of infrared radiation released
    * Variable sensitivity of the detector
    * Variable efficacy of the crystal window and lens system


* Relating to type of capnometer used  
E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> may be either **side-stream** or **in-line**.
    * Side-stream CO<sub>2</sub> involves a length of narrow tubing drawing gas from the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (typically from the HME filter) to the capnograph
        * Side-stream requires a flow of 150 ml.min<sup>-1</sup>  
        * Has a (pretty insignificant) delay (<1s) in measurement
        * May be blocked by water vapour, and require use of a water trap to remove condensation
    * In-line systems have a sampling chamber attached in-line with the ETT
        * The sampling chamber slightly increases the dead-space of the circuit  
        May be relevant in children or very difficult to ventilate patients.
        * Adds weight to patient end of the breathing circuit
        * Require heating to 41°C to avoid condensation


###Normal E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> Waveform{#capno}
<img src="\resources\capno-normal.svg">

The normal trace consists of four components:
1. The **baseline**  
This consists of:
    * Inspiratory time
    * Early **dead-space exhalation**  
    This is the period immediately before phase 2, where some gas with a PCO<sub>2</sub> of **0** is exhaled.
2. **Alveolar exhalation**, where PCO<sub>2</sub> **rises rapidly**
3. **Alveolar plateau**, where PCO<sub>2</sub> **flattens**  
The highest-point of this curve is labeled E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>.
4. **Inspiration**, where PCO<sub>2</sub> returns to **0**

###E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> Waveform Variations{#var}
**Airway obstruction:
**<img src="\resources\capno-obstruction.svg">
* Occurs due to uneven emptying of alveoli with different time-constants

**Hyperventilation:
**<img src="\resources\capno-hyperventilation.svg">
* Lower E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> with shorter baseline
* Plateau phase may not occur at very high respiratory rates

**Rebreathing**:
<img src="\resources\capno-rebreathing.svg">
* Baseline increases as inspired CO<sub>2</sub> is measured from gas analyser




###Changes in E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
Normal E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 32-42 mmHg, whilst normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> is 35-45 mmHg.

####High E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
This may be from:
* Decreased ventilation
    * Decreased RR
    * Decreased V<sub>T</sub>
    * Increased V<sub>D</sub> and therefore a greater V<sub>D</sub>:V<sub>T</sub> ratio
* Increased production of CO<sub>2</sub>
    * Increased metabolic rate
        * Sepsis
    * Tourniquet release
    * ROSC following arrest
* Increased inspired 
    * Rebreathing (i.e. equipment/ventilator malfunction)
    * External source of added CO<sub>2</sub>

####Low E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
#####Rapid Loss of E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
* Failure of ventilation
    * Circuit disconnect
    * Airway obstruction
    * Bronchospasm
* Failure of circulation
    * Cardiac arrest
    * Shock

#####Gradual Loss of E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>
* Increased V<sub>A</sub> (i.e. increased MV)
* Decreased CO<sub>2</sub> production
    * Hypometabolic state
        * Hypothermia
* Increased V<sub>D</sub>, i.e. V/Q mismatch
    * Increased West Zone I physiology:
        * Hypotension
        * Increased RV Afterload:
            * PE
            * High PEEP
* Sampling error
    * Air entrainment into the sample chamber
    * Inadequate V<sub>T</sub>

###Discrepancy between E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>, PACO<sub>2</sub>, and PaCO<sub>2</sub>
The normal gradient between PaCO<sub>2</sub> and E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> is 0-5 mmHg. Healthy and awake individuals should have essentially no (<1ml) alveolar dead space, and so essentially no gradient. This gradient is increased in patients with:
* V/Q mismatch
    * E<sub>T</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> will underestimate arterial CO<sub>2</sub> as gas from un-perfused alveoli (with negligible CO<sub>2</sub>) will dilute CO<sub>2</sub> expired gas

##Colourimetric Methods
Litmus paper which changes colour when exposed to hydrogen ions (produced by CO<sub>2</sub>) can be used to confirm endo-tracheal intubation, though they may generate false-positive results due to gastric pH.
