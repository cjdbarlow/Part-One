#Drug Interactions
>Classify and describe mechanisms of drug interaction.

Drug interactions occur "when the action of one drug modifies that of another".

##Mechanisms of Drug Interaction

Drug interactions are best classified into **three** categories:
* **Physicochemical**
* **Pharmacokinetic**
* **Pharmacodynamic**

###Physicochemical
Physicochemical interactions occur because of an incompatibility between chemical structures.

* e.g. Thiopentone and suxamethonium precipitate out of solution if prepared together or delivered together in the same line

###Pharmacokinetic
Pharmacokinetic interactions can be sub-classified into those affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination.

####Absorption
For oral medications, absorption may be affected by drugs which alter:
* Gastric pH
* Gastric emptying time

> Metoclopramide resolves gastric stasis and improves absorption of orally administered drugs

####Distribution
Distribution may be affected by:
* Competition for plasma protein binding  
  Loss of albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein
* Medications which alter cardiac output
* Displacement from tissue binding sites
  This typically occurs due to alteration of metabolic capacity of one drug by the other.
* Chelation of drug from tissues  
  Chelating agents bind toxic elements and prevent tissue damage

>Phenytoin is usually highly (90%) protein bound. A reduction in protein binding to 80% will double the free phenytoin level. For drugs with first-order kinetics, metabolism will increase proportionally however phenytoin rapidly saturates the enzyme system, leading to zero-order kinetics and a high plasma level.

> β-blockers reduce cardiac output and will prolong the time to fasciculation of suxamethonium.


####Metabolism
Metabolism may be affected by changes to the CYP450 enzymes:
* Enzyme induction
    * Barbiturates
    * Phenytoin
    * Carbamazepine
* Enzyme inhibition
    * Amiodarone  
    Amiodarone inhibits metabolism of S-warfarin by CYP2C9, enhancing its effect.
    * Diltiazem
    * Verapamil
    * Ciprofloxacin
    * Macrolides
    * Metronidazole
    * Grapefruit juice


####Elimination
Renal elimination can be affected by:
* Changes in urinary pH
* Competition for active tubular transport mechanisms

>Sodium bicarbonate increases urinary pH and enhances excretion of weak acids such as aspirin.

###Pharmacodynamic{#iso}
Pharmacodynamic interactions can be **direct**, due to interaction on the same receptor system; or **indirect**, when they act on different receptor system. These interactions can be classified as either:
* **Additive**  
  When the effects summate.
  * e.g. Administering midazolam with propofol reduces the amount of propofol required to generate an effect.
* **Antagonistic**  
  When the effects oppose each other.
  * e.g. Neostigmine indirectly antagonises the effect of NDMRs by increasing the level of ACh at the NMJ.
* **Synergistic**  
  When the combined effect is greater than would be expected from summation alone.
  * e.g. Co-administration of remifentanil and propofol has a synergistic effect in maintenance of anaesthesia.

These three interactions can be graphically demonstrated using an **isobologram**, which draws a **line of equal activity** versus **concentration** of two drugs.
