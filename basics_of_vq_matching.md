# Basics of V/Q Matching

Optimal gas exchange occurs when regions of lung are ventilated in proportion to their perfusion, i.e. V/Q = 1
* Uneven distribution of ventilation and perfusion causes inefficient gas exchange:
  * Excessive ventilation causes excessive work
  * Inadequate ventilation causes inadequate gas exchange

##Distribution of Ventilation

* The right lung is slightly better ventilated than the left
* In an erect patient the bases of the lung are better ventilated  
  The weight of lung above compresses the lung below, improving the compliance of dependent lung whilst stretching the non-dependent lung.
    * This is only significant at low inspiratory flow rates
    * The V/Q ratio in the bases is ~0.6
    * The V/Q ratio in the apices is >3
* In a lateral position:
  * The dependent lung is better ventilated in a spontaneously breathing patient
  * The non-dependent lung is better ventilated in a ventilated patient


##Distribution of Perfusion
* The pulmonary circulation is a low pressure circulation
* Gravity therefore has a substantial effect on fluid pressure
* Consequently, the distribution of blood throughout the lungs is uneven:
  * The **bases perfused better than the apices**  
  This is affected by lung volume, with the effect:
    * Becoming more pronounced at TLC (with apical perfusion falling precipitously)
    * Reversing slightly at RV

##V/Q Ratios{#reg}

* The global V/Q ratio for normal resting lung is **0.9**
* The global V/Q ratio improves to 1.0 during exercise

###V/Q Mismatch and Etymology
* V/Q mismatch occurs when V/Q ≠ 1:
  * **V/Q >1** (Dead Space)  
  Ventilation in excess of perfusion.
    * However, pulmonary blood is passing ventilated alveoli and PaO<sub>2</sub> is normal <br><br>
  * **V/Q 0 to 1**  (V/Q scatter)  
   Perfusion in excess of ventilation.
     * Increasing in PAO<sub>2</sub> will increase PaO<sub>2</sub>
     * This is commonly referred to by the general term of V/Q mismatch<br><br>
  * **V/Q = 0** (Shunt)  
Mixed venous blood entering the systemic circulation without being oxygenated via passage through the lungs. PaO<sub>2</sub> falls.
