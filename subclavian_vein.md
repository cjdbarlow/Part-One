# Subclavian Vein {#id}
> Describe the anatomy relevant to central venous access (including ~~femoral, internal jugular, external jugular,~~ subclavian ~~and peripheral~~ veins)

The subclavian vein:
* Is a continuation of the axillary vein as it crosses the **upper surface** of the **first rib**
* Travels posterior to the clavicle, separated from the subclavian artery by the anterior scalene
* **Joins** with the **internal jugular vein** to form the **brachiocephalic vein**


##Borders
* Anteriorly by the clavicle, subclavius muscle, and pectoralis major
* Posteriorly by anterior scalene muscle and subclavian artery
* Inferiorly by first rib and lung apex
* Superiorly by skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma
* Medially by the brachiocephalic vein
* Laterally by the axillary vein

##Surface Anatomy
The needle is placed in the deltopectoral groove, inferior and lateral to the middle third of the clavicle. The needle is inserted at a shallow angle, passing under the middle third of the clavicle aiming at the sternal notch.
