#Hypoxia {#id}
> Explain the physiological effects of hyperoxia, **hypoxaemia**, hypercapnia, hypocapnia, and carbon monoxide poisoning.

* **Hypoxaemia** is a low partial pressure of oxygen in blood
* **Hypoxia** is an oxygen deficiency at the **tissues**, due to:
  * Impaired **oxygen delivery**
  * Impaired **oxygen extraction**
 
 
Oxygen delivery is given by the equation:  
$$ DO_2 = HR \times SV \times (1.34 \times[Hb] \times SpO_2 + PaO_2 \times 0.003)$$, where:
* 1.34 is Hüfner's constant  
  This is the oxygen carrying capacity of haemoglobin, in ml.g<sup>-1</sup> (of Hb).
    * The theoretical maximum is 1.39
    * *In vivo* it is 1.34 due to the effect of carboxyhaemoglobin and methaemoglobin compounds, which limit O<sub>2</sub> binding
* 0.03 is the solubility coefficient of O<sub>2</sub> in water at 37ºC, in mls.mmHg<sup>-1</sup>  
Can also be expressed as 0.003 mls.dL<sup>-1</sup>.mmHg<sup>-1</sup> (mls per deciliter per mmHg). Different texts use different values, depending on whether haemoglobin is reported in g.L<sup>-1</sup> or g.100ml<sup>-1</sup>.

##Classifications and Causes of Hypoxia
Hypoxia can be categorised into four types:
* Hypoxic hypoxia  
* Anaemic hypoxia
* Ischaemic hypoxia
* Histotoxic hypoxia

###Hypoxic Hypoxia
Hypoxic hypoxia, or **hypoxaemia**, is hypoxia due to low PaO<sub>2</sub> (and therefore low SpO<sub>2</sub>), typically defined as a PaO<sub>2</sub><60.

Causes of hypoxaemia can be further classified based on their A-a gradient:
* Causes of hypoxaemia with a **normal A-a gradient**:
  * Low FiO<sub>2</sub>
  * Decreased alveolar ventilation
* Causes of hypoxaemia with a **raised A-a gradient**:
  * Diffusion limitation
  * Shunt
  * (Increased oxygen extraction)



####Low FiO<sub>2</sub>
Hypoxaemia occurs at high altitudes when the PO<sub>2</sub> is decreased.


####Decreased alveolar ventilation  
A fall in alveolar ventilation ($$ \dot{V_A} = Respiratory \ Rate \times (V_T - V_D)$$ ) causes a rise in PACO<sub>2</sub>, and therefore decreases PAO<sub>2</sub>. Decreased V<sub>A</sub> can occur with:  
* Respiratory centre depression:
    * Drugs
    * Head injury (Raised ICP, closed head injury)
    * Encephalopathy
    * Fatigue
* Nerve dysfunction:
    * Spinal cord injury
    * GBS
    * MND
* NMJ dysfunction:
    * Paralysis
    * MG
* Musular dysfunction:
    * Myopathy
    * Fatigue
    * Malnutrition
    * Dystrophy
* Chest wall abnormalities:
    * Kyphoscoliosis
    * Ankylosing Spondylitis
    * Pleural fibrosis

####Diffusion Limitation  
Impaired diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> across the membrane results in a lowered PaO<sub>2</sub>. Diffusion limitation occurs due to:
* Decreased alveolar surface area
* Increased alveolar capillary barrier thickness
  * Pulmonary fibrosis
  * ARDS

####Shunt  
Shunt occurs when **blood reaches the systemic circulation without being oxygenated via passage through the lung**. As the alveolus is **perfused** but **not ventilated**, thus the **V/Q ratio is 0**.
* Administration of 100% O<sub>2</sub> has less effect on PaO<sub>2</sub> as shunt fraction increases
  * Oxygen content of shunted alveoli is identical to mixed venous content
  * Oxygen content of non-shunted alveoli does not increase appreciably at high partial partial pressures as haemoglobin is already fully saturated

Shunt physiology is explored in more detail under [shunt](shunt.md).

####Increased Oxygen Extraction
* Increased oxygen extraction (VO<sub>2</sub>) will not typically cause hypoxia
* This is because:
  * Normal VO<sub>2</sub> is 250ml.min<sup>-1</sup>
  * Normal DO<sub>2</sub> is 1L.min<sup>-1</sup>  
  * Maximal oxygen extraction ratio is ~70% (though it varies between organs)  
  Therefore VO<sub>2</sub> can increase until it reaches 70% of the DO<sub>2</sub>, a point called critical DO<sub>2</sub>.
* However, it may worsen hypoxia in the presence of a supply-side (DO<sub>2</sub>) pathology

###Anaemic Hypoxia
* Impaired oxygen delivery due to low Hb
* Typically asymptomatic at rest but limits exercise tolerance

* Compensation occurs by increasing levels of 2,3-DPG, causing a right-shift in the Hb-O<sub>2</sub> dissociation curve to favour oxygen off-loading at tissues

####Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
* CO poisoning is classified as a subset of anaemic hypoxia as carboxyhaemoglobin **reduces** the **effective** amount of **haemoglobin** in solution
* CO has 210 times the affinity for Hb than O<sub>2</sub>
  * CO rapidly displaces O<sub>2</sub> from Hb and is liberated slowly
* CO poisoning causes headache and nausea, but no increased respiratory drive since the PaO<sub>2</sub> is unchanged

###Ischaemic Hypoxia
* Ischaemic hypoxia is due to impaired cardiac output resulting in impaired oxygen delivery

###Histotoxic Hypoxia
* Histotoxic hypoxia is due to impaired tissue oxidative processes, preventing utilisatioin of delivered oxygen
* Most common cause of histotoxic hypoxia is cyanide poisoning, which inhibits cytochrome oxidase and prevents oxidative phosphorylation
* Managed by using methylene blue or nitrites, which form methhaemoglobin, in turn reacting with cyanide to form the non-toxic cyanmethaemoglobin

##Effects of Hypoxia
* With a normal PaCO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub> must fall to 50mmHg before an increase in ventilation occurs
* With a rising PaCO<sub>2</sub>, a fall in PaO<sub>2</sub> below 100mmHg will stimulate ventilation via action on carotid and aortic body chemoreceptors
  * The effects of each stimuli are synergistic, and greater than what is seen with either effect alone


* Prolonged hypoxaemia will also lead to cerebral acidosis (via anaerobic metabolism), which will stimulate central pH receptors and stimulate ventilation

###Acid-Base Changes
* Hypoxia results in both fixed and volatile acid-base disturbances
* Anaerobic metabolism results in **lactate** production
* Production of fixed acid results in a **base deficit**, and a low bicarbonate
* Hypoxia and metabolic acidosis stimulate ventilation and hypocarbia

###CO<sub>2</sub> retention
* In chronic hypercarbia the CSF pH normalises (as bicarbonate is secreted into CSF), with a raised CO<sub>2</sub>
* Fall in PaO<sub>2</sub> becomes the predominant stimulus for ventilation
