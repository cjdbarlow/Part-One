# Determinants of Cardiac Output {#id}

*This section covers determinants of cardiac output from the perspective of the heart. The relationship to and importance of [venous return](venous-return.md) is covered elsewhere.*

> Define the components and determinants of cardiac output

Cardiac output a function of Heart Rate (HR) and Stroke Volume (SV):  
$$CO = HR \times SV $$.

* **Heart rate** is fairly intuitive
* **Stroke volume** is defined as the difference between ESV and EDV, i.e. $$ SV = EDV - ESV$$  
Stroke volume is a function of three factors:  
  * **Preload**
  * **Afterload**
  * **Contractility**


* Preload and afterload have [almost as many definitions as there are textbooks](http://advan.physiology.org/highwire/markup/5806/expansion?width=1000&height=500&iframe=true&postprocessors=highwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media)
* For the purpose of the exam, it's good to have both a laboratory and a clinical definition
* These definitions are those which have appeared in old examiner reports, or given to me by cardiac anaesthetists

##Preload
**Preload** is defined as the **myocardial sarcomere length just prior to contraction**.
* As this is not measurable without removing the heart and cutting it into tiny pieces, clinically it is usually **approximated by EDV** or, less appropriately, by EDP
  * EDV is typically calculated on echocardiography
  * EDP is typically measured using a CVC or PAC
    * CVP ≈ RVEDP
    * PCWP ≈ LVEDP


###Determinants of Preload
Preload is a function of:
* **Venous Return**
  * Intrathoracic Pressure
  * MSFP
    * Venous compliance  
    A decrease in venous compliance will increase LVEDP.
    * Volume state
* **Ventricular compliance**  
Reduced in diastolic dysfunction.
* **Pericardial compliance**
* **Valvular disease**  
  * AV valve disease will **impair** preload
  * Semilunar valve disease will **increase** preload
* **Atrial kick**
* **Wall thickness**  
Increased ventricular wall thickness decreases preload.
    * HOCM/Hypertrophy  


###Preload and the Respiratory Cycle
* Negative intrathoracic pressure causes RAP and PCWP to fall
* This increases RA filling, so and RVEDP and RVEDV increase relative to the pleural pressure (though absolute pressure is still low)
* LV effects are more variable  
Negative intrapleural pressures:
  * Increase LV transmural pressure  
  This impairs ejection.
  * Cause bowing of the interventricular septum into the LV  
  This reduces LVEDV.


###Frank-Starling Mechanism{#frank}
* The **Frank-Starling Law of the Heart** states that the **strength of cardiac contraction is dependent on initial fibre length**
* At a cellular level, additional stretch increases:
  * The number of myofilament crossbridges that can interact
  * Myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity
  

* This law is represented by the **ventricular function curve**  
Plot of preload against stroke volume (or cardiac output, assuming a constant heart rate).
  * Right shift of the curve demonstrates negative inotropy
  * Left shift of the curve demonstrates positive inotropy

The failing ventricle:
<img src="resources\starling-curve-failing.svg">
* In cardiac failure, the ventricle becomes overstretched  
This reduces the number of overlapping crossbridges, reducing contractility.
* This is limited in the acute setting by constriction of the pericardium, which prevents excessive ventricular dilation




##Afterload
**Afterload** is **the sum of forces, both elastic and kinetic, opposing ventricular ejection**
* This definition is a bit wordy but avoids using the words "resistance" and "impedance", which are strictly defined in physics (and crudely applied in medicine), and may be leapt on by the cruel examiner

This equates to **ventricular wall stress**, which is given by the equation:
 
$$ \theta \propto {P \times r \over T}$$, where:
* $$\theta$$ is ventricular wall stress
* $$r$$ is ventricular chamber radius  
This is a proxy for ventricular size, or end-diastolic volume.
* $$P$$ is ventricular transmural pressure
* $$T$$ is ventricular wall thickness



###End-Diastolic Volume 
An increase in EDV increases ventricular radius and therefore wall tension.
     

###Myocardial wall thickness
Increasing wall thickness (seen clinically as ventricular hypertrophy) *decreases* afterload by sharing wall tension (the product of pressure and radius) between a larger number of sarcomeres.


###Ventricular transmural systolic pressure
Transmural pressure is the difference between intrathoracic pressure and the ventricular cavity pressure during ejection. Transmural pressure is dependent on:
* **Intrathoracic Pressure**  
Negative intrathoracic pressure will increase afterload, as the ventricle has to generate a greater change in pressure to achieve ejection.
  * PEEP reduces LV afterload
  * Negative-pressure ventilation with a high work of breathing increases afterload  
  This is why APO deteriorates - increased work of breathing increases LV afterload and worsens LV failure, increased pulmonary oedema, causing increased work of breathing... <br><br>
* **Ventricular cavity pressure**  
To facilitate ejection, the ventricle must overcome:
  * **Outflow tract impedance**
    * Valvular disease
      * e.g. aortic stenosis
    * HOCM
  * **Systemic arterial impedance**  
  Determined by resistance (SVR), **inertia, and **compliance:  
      * Determinants of **resistance** are stated in the Poiseuille Equation:  
          $$ R = {8.\eta.l \over \pi.r^4}$$, where:
          * η = **Viscosity**  
          Affected by **haematocrit** (e.g. increased in polycythaemia) 
          * l = Vessel length  
          Essentially fixed.
          * r = Vessel **radius**  
            * Greatest determinant
            * Function of **degree of vasoconstriction** of resistance vessels
      * **Inertia**  
        * Given by the mass of blood in the column
        * Affected by **heart rate**
      * Arterial **compliance**  
      Decreased arterial compliance increases afterload.
        * During ejection, the aorta and large arteries distend, reducing peak systolic pressure (impedance to further ejection)
          * Decreased arterial compliance increases the change in pressure for any given volume, increasing afterload during ejection
          * Decreased arterial compliance increases the speed of propagation of **reflected pressures waves** returning to the aortic root
            * Wave arrival in diastole augments coronary blood flow
            * Wave arrival during systole further increases afterload
        * In diastole the arteries recoil and blood pressure and flow are maintained - the **Windkessel effect**.



##Contractility
**Contractility **describes the** factors other than heart rate, preload, and afterload that are responsible for for changes in myocardial performance**.

###Determinants of Contractility
Contractility is primarily dependent on **intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>**.  Determinants include:
* Drugs
* Disease
  * Ischaemia  
  Reduced ATP production secondary to hypoxia, which impairs sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> function. Further exacerbated by intracellular acidosis from anaerobic metabolism.
  * Heart Failure  
  Impaired **contractility reserve**, i.e. minimal increase in contractility with sympathetic stimulation.
    * Reduced peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup>
* Autonomic Tone
* Bowditch Effect  
Contractility improves at faster heart rates. This is because the myocardium does not have time to remove calcium, so it accumulates intracellularly.
* Anrep Effect  
Contractility increases as afterload increases.

###Measuring Contractility{#cont}
 * As with the other determinants of cardiac output, there has been some difficulty in developing measurable indices for contractility
 * All measures of contractility are affected by preload or afterload to some extent


* **dP/dt<sub>max</sub>** ($$\Delta P \over \Delta T$$)  
 The **rate of rise** of LVP, assuming a constant preload and afterload
   * This index is **preload dependent** but **afterload independent**
   * Typically, the dP/dt<sub>max</sub> in isovolumetric ventricular contraction is used
   * A greater rate of rise indicates a more forceful contraction
   * Measurement requires LV catheterisation


* **End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship**
  * Uses the ventricular Pressure-Volume Relationship
  * Line plotted at the tangent to the curve from the **end-systolic point** (when isovolumetric ventricular relaxation begins)
    * The steeper the gradient the greater the contractility


* **Ejection Fraction**  
Most common method used clinically is **ejection fraction**:  
$$EF \ (\%) = {SV \over EDV } \times 100 = {EDV - ESV \over EDV} \times 100 $$
