#Compliance
> Define compliance (static, dynamic and specific), its measurement, and relate this to the elastic properties of the respiratory system.

* Compliance is the **change in volume** for a **given a change in pressure**  
Compliance is measured in ml.cmH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>-1</sup>.x
* It occurs due to the tendency of a tissue to resume its original position after removal of an applied force
* It is the inverse of **elastance**, which is the force at which the lung recoils for a given distension
* A decreased compliance means the transpulmonary pressure must change by a greater amount for a given volume, which increases elastic work of breathing

##Compliance of the Respiratory System
* Compliance of the respiratory system is a function of both lung and chest wall compliance:  
$$ {1 \over C_T \ } = {1 \over C_L} + {1 \over C_W \ } $$. 

* The curve is not linear as compliance varies with lung volume
In the normal range however, (-5 to -10cmH<sub>2</sub>O) compliance is typically stated as **~200ml.cmH<sub>2</sub>O<sup>-1</sup>**.

###Measurement of Lung and Chest Wall Compliance
* Lung compliance is calculated form the alveolar-intrapleural pressure gradient
* Chest-wall compliance is calculated from the intrapleural-ambient pressure gradient
* Total compliance is calculated from the alveolar-ambient gradient


* Measuring ambient and alveolar pressure is straightfoward, as is calculating compliance of the respiratory system
  * Alveolar pressure is measured by taking a plateau pressure
* Separating lung and chest wall compliance requires measurement of intrapleural pressure  
This is performed by measuring oesophageal pressure (using a balloon) with an **open glottis**, as oesophageal pressure approximates intrapleural pressure.


* Measurement of compliance of each system individually determines what proportion of plateau pressure is distributed to each
  * If the lung is significantly less compliant than the chest wall, a greater pressure is required to distend the lung
  * Therefore, the alveolar-intrapleural gradient will be much greater than the intrapleural-ambient gradient
  * This can be expressed by the equation:  
$$ \Delta P_{Pl.} = P_{Plat.} \times {C_L \over C_L + C_W } $$

##Static Compliance
* **Static compliance** is the compliance of the system at a given volume when there is no flow
* Therefore there is no pressure component due to resistance
* A static compliance curve is made by measuring the pressure across a range of lung volumes, with patient taking incremental breaths
* Static compliance is a function of:
  * Elastic recoil of the lung  
  * Surface tension of alveoli

##Dynamic Compliance

* **Dynamic compliance** is the compliance measured during respiration, using continuous pressure and volume measurements
* Therefore, dynamic compliance **includes the pressure required to generate flow** by overcoming resistance forces
  * This means it is also a bit of misnomer
* **Dynamic compliance is always less than static compliance**, as there will always be a degree of airway resistance
* Dynamic compliance is a function of respiratory rate  
In normal lungs at normal respiratory rates it approximates static compliance.
* Reduced in in lung units with unequal time constants at high respiratory rates
    * Due to incomplete filling of alveoli - the portion of pressure that is used to overcome airways resistance is therefore proportionally greater

##Specific Compliance
**Specific compliance** is the compliance per unit volume of lung, expressed as:  
$$ C_S = {C_{Tot} \over FRC} $$
* Specific compliance is used to compare different lungs

##Hysteresis
* In general, hysteresis refers to any process where **the future state of a system is dependent on its current and previous state**
* Specific to the lung, it means the compliance of the lung is different in inspiration and expiration
* There is hysteresis in both static and dynamic curves:
  * In dynamic compliance curves:  
  Airways resistance is a function of flow rate. Flow rate (therefore resistance) is maximal at the beginning of inspiration and end-expiration.
  * In static compliance curves:  
  There is no resistive component. Hysteresis is due to viscous resistance of surfactant and the lung.

##Changes in Compliance
Respiratory system compliance can be affected by changes to either lung or chest wall compliance, and can be increased or decreased.

###Increased Lung Compliance
* Normal aging
* Asthma attack
* Emphysema

###Decreased Lung Compliance  
* Alterations in lung volume and consolidation  
  Compliance is reduced at **extremes of lung volume**. It is **highest at FRC**.
    * Children
    * Pneumonectomy/lobectomy
    * Atelectasis/collapse
    * Pneumonia
    * ARDS
* Increased pulmonary blood volume/**venous congestion**
    * APO 
* Increased surface tension
    * **Reduced surfactant**
        * Hyaline Membrane Disease
* **Impaired elasticity**
    * Pulmonary fibrosis

###Increased Chest Wall Compliance
* Collagen disorders

###Decreased Chest Wall Compliance
* **Chest wall restriction**/structural abnormalities
    * Obesity
    * Spastic paralysis of chest wall musculature
    * Ossification of costal cartilages
    * Kyphosis/scoliosis
    * Scarring/constriction (e.g. circumferential burns)
* **Position**
    * Prone (60% reduced compliance)/supine  
      This is due to the effect of position on lung volume.
