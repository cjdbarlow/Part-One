#Variations in Blood Pressure
> Describe the physiological factors that may contribute to pulse variations in blood pressure

Blood pressure is not uniform throughout the circulation. Ventricular ejection generates two waves:
* A **blood flow wave**  
Travels at **~20cm.s<sup>-1</sup>**.
* An **arterial pressure wave**  
Distends the elastic walls of the large arteries during systole, which then recoil during diastole to facilitate continual blood flow. This is the **Windkessel effect**.
    * This wave travels at **4m.s<sup>-1</sup>**
    * **This is** what is **felt** when **pulses** are **palpated**, and what is **seen** on the **arterial line** waveform


Key pressures measured are:
* **Systolic blood pressure**  
Maximal pressure generated during ejection.
    * Determined by:
        * Stroke volume
        * Systolic time
        * Arterial compliance
        * Reflected pressure wave
    * Relevant for:
        * Bleeding  
            * Clot disruption
            * Aneurysmal wall pressure
* **Diastolic pressure**  
Pressure exerted by the circulation upon the aortic valve.
    * Determined by:
        * Circulatory compliance
        * Circulating volume
        * Aortic valve (in)competence
    * Relevant for:
        * Coronary perfusion
* **Mean arterial pressure**  
Average pressure in the circulation throughout the cardiac cycle, as measured by the **area under the curve** of the arterial line waveform.
    * Determined by:
        * Systolic blood pressure
        * Diastolic blood pressure
        * **Heart rate**  
        Increasing HR will tend to increase MAP, as overall systolic time (and therefore time spent at higher pressure) is increased.
        * Shape of the arterial waveform/diastolic runoff  
        The slow decrease in pressure after peak systolic pressure represent elastic recoil of large arteries, increasing the pressure driving blood into the peripheral circulation. A longer diastolic runoff period leads to a larger area under the curve, and a higher MAP.
    * Relevant for:
        * Organ perfusion



##Changes by Site of Measurement
Measured pressure changes predictably at more distal sites:
* All gradients are increased  
Arterial upstroke and falloff are both steeper.
* The SBP increases
* DBP decreases
* **MAP is constant**
* The dicrotic notch occurs later and becomes less sharp  
This occurs due to reflections in arterial pressure waves.

##Respiratory Variation
Ventilation causes variation in peak systolic pressure due to dynamic changes in cardiac loading conditions:
* **Negative pressure respiration** (i.e. regular breathing) generates a negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration  
This:
    * **Augments right** ventricular function
        * Increased VR  
        Via negative intrathoracic pressure.
        * Increases RVEDV  
        RV moves up the Starling curve.
    * **Impedes left** ventricular function
        * Pooling of blood in the pulmonary circulation
        * Decreased LVEDV  
        LV filling restricted by increased RV EDV; this is an example of **intraventricular interdependence**.
        * Increased afterload  
        Negative intrathoracic pressure increases LV transmural pressure, increasing wall tension, and therefore afterload.
        * Decrease in SV and SBP
* **Positive pressure ventilation** causes *generally* opposite effects
Increased intrathoracic pressure during inspiration:
    * Decreases VR but increases LV filling via compression of the pulmonary circulation
    * Note that LV afterload is reduced throughout the respiratory cycle with the application of PEEP
* When this change is **>10mmHg**, it is known as **pulsus paradoxus**
* The magnitude of this effect varies with:
    * Magnitude of intrathoracic pressure change  
    Large changes in intrathoracic pressure cause correspondingly larger changes in ventricular filling.
    * Other factors affecting cardiovascular function
        * Preload
            * Volume state
        * Compliance
            * Pericardial compliance
                * Constriction
                * Tamponade
            * Cardiac compliance
                * Diastolic dysfunction
        * Afterload
            * PE
            * Raised intrathoracic pressure
                * PEEP
                * Tension PTHx
* These differences can be measured:
    * Qualitatively  
    By looking at respiratory swing on an arterial line or plethysmograph; or by palpation.
    * Quantitatively  
    Using **pulse pressure** or **stroke volume variation**.

###Pulse Pressure Variation
Describes the variation in pulse pressure over the course of a respiratory cycle. Pulse pressure variation is:
* Mathematically defined as:  
$$PPV = {Pulse \ Pressure_{maximum} - Pulse \ Pressure_{minimum} \over Pulse \ Pressure_{mean}} \times 100 $$
    * Therefore, it is calculated as a **percent**
* Used as an indicator of **fluid responsiveness**  
    * Patients higher on the **Frank-Starling curve** will have less change in stroke volume with an increase in preload, and therefore:
        * Reduced PPV
        * Be less fluid responsive
    * A PPV of **>12%** suggests volume responsiveness.
    * Note that this does not necessarily mean a fluid responsive patient needs fluid.
* Reliant on several assumptions:
    * Regular sinus rhythm  
    Irregular heart rates (particularly AF) lead to significant alterations in ventricular filling and therefore pulse pressure, independent of the respiratory cycle.
    * Controlled mechanical ventilation  
    No spontaneous efforts.
    * Adequate tidal volumes  
    Must be >8mL.kg<sup>-1</sup>.
    * Normal chest wall compliance  
    Requires a closed chest.


###Stroke Volume Variation
SVV is:
* Alternately defined as:
    * The percent change in stroke volume during inspiration and expiration over the previous **20 seconds**
    * Variation of beat-to-beat SV from the **mean value** over the previous 20 seconds  
    $$SVV = {SV_{max} - SV_{min} \over SV_{mean}} \times 100$$
* Calculated by specialised devices from an invasive arterial waveform  
Calculation incorporates:
    * Pulse pressure
    * Vascular compliance  
    Estimated from nomograms based on patient age, gender, height, and weight.
    * Vascular resistance  
    Estimated from arterial waveform shape.
* An alternative to PPV in measuring fluid responsiveness  
Relies on similar principles.
* Probably less specific but more sensitive than PPV for identifying fluid responders  

##Circulatory Factors
Changes in circulatory function:
* **Inotropy**  
The rate of systolic upstroke is related to $$\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta t}$$, and therefore contractility.
* **SVR**  
The gradient between the peak systolic pressure and the dicrotic notch gives an indication of SVR. E.g., a steep downstroke suggests a low SVR, as the pressure in the circulation rapidly falls when ejection ceases.
* **Preload**  
A beat-to-beat variation is seen with the respiratory cycle, due to the change in preload occurring with changes in intrathoracic pressure.

###Pathological Changes
Some pathological causes include:
* **Aortic Stenosis**  
Causes a reduction in:
    * Pulse pressure  
    Due to reduced stroke volume.
    * Gradient of upstroke  
    Due to reduced stroke volume.
* **Aortic Regurgitation**  
    * Wide pulse pressure  
    Combination of:
        * Increased SBP due to the increased force of ejection due to increased preload (Starlings Law), which occurs due to high ESV
        * Decreased DBP due to part of the stroke volume flowing back into the ventricle through the incompetent valve
