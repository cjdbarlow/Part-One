# Potassium
> Describe the function, distribution, regulation and physiological importance of ~~sodium, chloride,~~ potassium, ~~magnesium, calcium and phosphate~~ ions.

Potassium is the major intracellular cation, with 90% of total body potassium present in the ICF. A further 8% is sequestered in bone, with 2% present in the ECF.
* Normal ECF concentration is 3.5-5mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>
* Normal ICF concentration is ~150mmol.L<sup>-1</sup>

##Function and Dysfunction
Potassium is important for:
* Regulation of intracellular pH
* Control of intracellular volume
* DNA and protein synthesis
* Enzymatic function
* Resting membrane potential

The **resting membrane potential** is determined by the ratio of intracellular:extracellular potassium, as per the Nernst equation:
* Small changes in extracellular ion concentration produce large changes in voltage  
This has significant effect on excitable tissues.
* Rapid changes in potassium concentration cause symptoms at lower levels than chronic changes  
Symptoms are related to the change in action potential generation.

###Hyperkalaemia
Hyperkalaemia causes:
* The resting membrane potential to become less negative  
As per the Nernst equation.
 * This results in the resting membrane potential being closer to the threshold potential, increasing irritability
 * Several symptoms, including:
  * Weakness
  * Paralysis
  * Parasthesias
  * ECG findings are those of **prolonged depolarisation** and **rapid repolarisation**:  
  
|Serum [K<sup>+</sup>] (mmol/L)|ECG Findings|
|--|--|
|5.5-6.5|Tall tented T waves|
|6.5-7.5|Loss of P wave, lengthening PR interval|
|7.5-8.5|Widening QRS|
|>8.5|Sine-wave QRS|




###Hypokalaemia
Hypokalaemia:
* Causes the resting membrane potential to become more-negative  
This makes it more difficult for a stimulus to reach the threshold potential, and therefore it is harder to generate and propagate action potential.
* ECG findings are those of **rapid depolarisation** and **prolonged repolarisation**, and include:
 * Prolonged PR
 * Long QT
 * Flat T waves or TWI
 * U waves
 * ST depression
 * Severe hypokalaemia may result in:
  * Frequent supraventricular and ventricular ectopics
  * Supraventricular arrhythmias
  * Ventricular arrhythmias


##Regulation
Serum potassium is dependent on intake, sequestration, and elimination.

###Intake
Dietary intake may be highly variable. Potassium is completely absorbed from the upper GI tract.

###Sequestration
Several factors affect potassium sequestration:
* **Insulin** and **Î²<sub>2</sub>-agonism** results in increase activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump, shifting potassium into cells following a meal and during exercise
* **Acidosis** causes an **extracellular** shift of potassium, as hydrogen ions are exchanged for potassium ions  
The reverse occurs in alkalosis.
* **Cell lysis** may release a large amount of potassium into circulation and cause significant hyperkalaemia if a large number of cells are destroyed
* **Aldosterone** increases uptake of potassium into cells

###Elimination
Elimination of potassium occurs via the kidneys, and is dependent on production of large volumes of glomerular filtrate and secretion by the **distal convoluted tubule** and **collecting duct**.

In normal conditions:
* The PCT and ascending limb reabsorb the majority of absorbed potassium  
This is essentially fixed.
 * PCT absorbs ~55%
 * Ascending limb absorbs ~30%
* The principal cells of the DCT and collecting duct secrete potassium  
Altering potassium secretion is the main method by which the kidney regulates serum potassium.
 * The collecting duct has a much greater role than the DCT
 * With normal dietary intake, more potassium is secreted than reabsorbed  
 This changes in conditions of potassium depletion.

####Control of Tubular Secretion
Tubular potassium secretion is mainly a function of:
* **Plasma [K<sup>+</sup>]**  
Increased plasma [K<sup>+</sup>] stimulates the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump in the principal cells, and also stimulates aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex. 
* **Tubular flow rate**  
Movement of potassium out of principal cells occurs down a passive concentration gradient. Increasing tubular flow rate increases the concentration gradient for potassium
* **Aldosterone**  
Aldosterone increases production of the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump, which increases potassium secretion and uptake into cells.

Minor contributors include:
* Sodium and water content  
 * High sodium content inhibits aldosterone release, reducing potassium elimination
 * High water content inhibits ADH excretion and reduces secretion of potassium, however high water content also increases flow through the renal tubule, which indirectly increases tubular secretion of potassium.
* Alkalosis  
Alkalosis increases elimination of potassium as the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> ATPase pump is stimulated by low H<sup>+</sup> ion concentration.
