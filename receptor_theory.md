> To explain the Law of Mass Action and describe affinity and dissociation constants

A **receptor** is a component of a cell which interacts with a drug and **initiates a sequence of events leading to an observed change in function**.
* Existence of receptors is inferred from the response of tissues to drugs, genome sequencing, and molecular biology.
* A drug binds to a receptor forming a **receptor-drug complex**, which initiates a cascade of events to exert a pharmacological effect. 

##Dissociation Constants
Interaction between a receptor and a drug is based upon the **law of mass action**, which states the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the masses of reacting substances. This can be expressed as:  
$$ [Drug] + [Receptor] \Leftrightarrow [Drug-Receptor] $$

The ratio of the **rate constant** for the forwards reaction (**K<sub>association</sub>**) and the backwards reaction (**K<sub>dissociation</sub>**) is the **dissociation constant**. This is the concentration of drug when 50% of receptors are occupied:

$$ K_D = {[D][R] \over [D-R]} $$

A **low K<sub>D</sub>** value indicates that a lower concentration of drug is required to occupy 50% of the receptor, indicating that the drug has a **high affinity** for the receptor.

Physiological factors which affect the dissociation constant are determined by the **Arrhenius equation**:

$$ k = Ae^{-E_A \over RT} $$, where:
* $$A$$ is a constant
* $$T$$ is **temperature** in kelvin
* $$E_A$$ is the activation energy required, which may be lowered by a **catalyst**
* $$R$$ is the gas constant

##Properties of Drugs
Key properties of drugs include:
* **Potency**  
The **amount** of drug required to have an effect.
    * Given by the (typically the E<sub>D</sub>50)
    * This relates to **Bowman's principle**, which states that the **least potent** anaesthetic agents have the **quickest onset**  
    This is because they are administered in **higher doses** (as they are less potent, more is required to get an effect), which results in a **high concentration gradient** and a **rapid distribution** into tissues.


* **Efficacy**  
The **maximal** effect that a drug can generate.


* **Intrinsic activity**  
The size of effect a drug has when bound, which is graded from 0 to 1. 
    * This is also known as **activity**


##Drug-Receptor Interactions
Drugs can be classified by the way they interact with receptors into:
* **Agonists**
    * Partial agonists
    * Inverse agonists
* **Antagonists**
    * Indirect antagonists
* **Allosteric Modulators**
* **Mixed Agonist-Antagonists**

##Agonists{#agon}
An agonist will generate a **maximal** response at the receptor site. An agonist has **high affinity** and an **activity of 1**. Agonists can be compared by:
* **Relative potency** implies that if two agonists are equally efficacious, a smaller dose of one is required to get an effect
* **Relative efficacy** implies that the maximal effect of one agonist is greater than the other

###Partial agonist
A partial agonist generates a **submaximal** response at the receptor. A partial agonist has a **high affinity** and an **activity between 0 and 1**. A partial agonist can act as an effective antagonist in the presence of a full agonist, as it will prevent maximal binding at a receptor, even with a high agonist concentration.

###Inverse agonist 
A drug which has a **negative activity** (between 0 and -1) producing the **opposite** response (compared to the endogenous agonist) at receptor.
* Occurs due to loss of **constitutive activity** at that receptor

##Antagonist{#antagon} 
An antagonist produces no response at the receptor site, and prevents other ligands binding. Antagonists have **high affinity** and an **activity of 0**.

Antagonists with these properties are also known as **direct antagonists**, which can be either:
* **Competitive antagonists**  
Displace other ligands from a binding site. Competitive antagonists can be:
    * Reversible  
    The effect can be overridden by increasing the dose of agonist.
    * Irreversible  
    Drug cannot be overridden by increasing dose of agonist. Dose-response curve appears similar to that of the non-competitive antagonist.
* **Non-competitive antagonists**  
Create a conformational change in the receptor. They cannot be overridden by increasing the dose of agonist.

####Indirect Antagonist
Indirect antagonists reduce the clinical effect of a drug, but do so via means other than receptor interaction. They include:
* **Chemical antagonists**  
Where the drug binds directly to another. Examples include protamine and heparin, and sugammadex and rocuronium.
* **Physiologic antagonists**  
A countering effect is produced by agonism of other pathways.



##Allosteric Modulator
A drug which binds to an allosteric site on the receptor and produces conformational change that alters the affinity of the receptor for the endogenous agonist.

Allosteric modulators can be:
* Positive  
Increases affinity for endogenous agonist.
    * e.g. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators at the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
* Negative  
Decreases affinity for endogenous agonist.

##Mixed Agonist-Antagonist
A drug which has different effects on different receptors.
