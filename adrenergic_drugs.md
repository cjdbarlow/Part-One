#Adrenergic Vasoactives {#id}

*This covers the pharmacology of specific catecholamines and sympathomimetics. The synthesis of endogenous catecholamines is covered under [adrenal hormones](adrenal-hormones.md), whilst specifics of catecholamine receptor function is covered under [adrenoreceptors](adrenoreceptors.md).*



Adrenergic drugs:
* Act via:
 * Dopamine receptors (D)
 * Adrenoreceptors (α and β)
* Can be:
 * **Direct-acting**  
 Stimulate the receptor.
 * **Indirect-acting**  
 Stimulate the release of noradrenaline to cause effects.
* Classified as either:
 * **Naturally-occurring catecholamines**
 * **Synthetic catecholamines**
 * **Synthetic sympathomimetics**  
 Drugs which act on adrenoreceptors but are not classified as catecholamines due to their chemical structure.

##Structure-Activity Relationships of Sympathomimetics
<img src="\resources\dopamine.svg">

Catecholamines consist of:
* A catechol ring  
A benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups in the 3 and 4 position.
  * Losing one hydroxyl group
    * Increases lipid solubility and decreases the potency 10-fold
    * Prevents metabolism by COMT, prolonging duration of action
  * Losing both hydroxyl groups decreases the potency 100-fold
	* Changing the hydroxyl groups to the 3 and 5 position increases beta-2 selectivity when there is also a large substitution present on the amine group
* An ethylamine tail  
Consists of:
 * Beta carbon  
 The first carbon.
   * Adding a hydroxyl group decreases lipid solubility and CNS penetration
   * Adding any group increases alpha and beta selectivity
 * Alpha carbon  
 The second carbon.
   * Adding a group prevents metabolism by MAO, prolonging duration of action
   * Methylation increases indirect activity
 * Amine group  
 The terminal nitrogen.
   * Addition of a methyl group generally increases beta selectivity  
   As the chain length increases, so does the beta selectivity.

###Dopamine
<img src="\resources\dopamine.svg">

* Dopamine is the prototypical catecholamine, to which others are compared

###Noradrenaline

<img src="\resources\noradrenaline.svg">

* Noradrenaline has a hydroxyl group added to the beta carbon, increasing its alpha selectivity

###Adrenaline
<img src="\resources\adrenaline.svg">

* Adrenaline is similar to noradrenaline with an additional hydroxyl group on the beta carbon
* Adrenaline also has a methyl group added to the terminal amine, increasing beta selectivity

###Metaraminol
<img src="\resources\metaraminol.svg">

* Metaraminol has an additional hydroxyl group on the beta carbon
* Metaraminol has only one hydroxyl group on the phenol ring, so:
  * It is no longer classified as a catecholamine
  * It is not metabolised by COMT, prolonging its duration of action
  * It has reduced potency, requiring administration in higher doses
* Metaraminol has an additional methyl group on the alpha carbon, preventing metabolism by MAO and further prolonging its duration of action

##Ephedrine
<img src="\resources\ephedrine.svg">

* Like metaraminol, ephedrine has a hydroxyl group on the beta carbon and a methyl group on the alpha carbon
* Ephedrine has no hydroxyl groups on the phenol ring, further reducing its potency and increasing its elimination half-life
* Ephedrine has a methyl group on the amine, increasing its beta selectivity
