#Drug Approval and Development
>Describe the processes by which new drugs are approved for research and clinical use in Australia, and to outline the phases of human drug trials (Phase I-IV)

##Drug Approval
The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approves medicine for both research and clinical use in Australia.

###Research
Drug trials are approved for research purposes under two schemes:  

1. Clinical Trials Exemption  
  Drugs must be evaluated by an expert committee to evaluate all aspects of pharmacology, toxicology, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, organ dysfunction, and other side-effects.
2. Clinical Trials Notification  
  A drug which has been approved in another nation with similarly stringent requirements (New Zealand, Netherlands, UK, Sweden, US) may be used in a trial with oversight by a local ethics committee.

###Clinical Use
The TGA classifies medicines into:

* **Registered Medicines**  
Assessed by the TGA for quality, safety, and efficacy.
    * All prescription (high-risk) medicines. Assessed on:
        * **Quality**
            * Composition of drug substance
            * Batch consistency
            * Stability data
            * Sterility data (if applicable)
            * Impurities
        * **Non-clinical**
            * Pharmacology data
            * Toxicology data
        * **Clinical**
            * Efficacy: results of clinical trials
    * Most OTC (low-risk) medicines
    * Some complementary medicines
* **Listed Medicines**  
Assessed by the TGA for quality, safety, but not efficacy.
    * Some OTC medicines
    * Most complementary medicines

##Phases of Drug Development
###"Phase 0"
* Pre-clinical R&D
* *In vitro* and animal testing

###Phase I
* First administration in humans
* Basic pharmacokinetic and toxicology data
* 20 - 100 human subjects

###Phase II
* Administration to select patient groups
* Aim to establish dose-response curve
* Evidence of efficacy

###Phase III
* Full-scale evaluation of benefits, potential risks and costs analysis
* 2000-3000 patients, usually treated in groups of several hundred for relatively short durations (3-6 months), regardless of the length of time the drug will be used in practice[^3]
    * May not reveal uncommon or long-term risks

###Phase IV
* Post-marketing surveillance
