# Myocardial Oxygen Supply and Demand
> Describe myocardial oxygen demand and supply, and the conditions that may alter each

* Myocardial oxygen supply is a function of coronary blood flow
* Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by myocardial work
* Myocardial ischaemia occurs when demand exceeds supply

##Myocardial Oxygen Supply
* Myocardial oxygen supply is dependent on:
  *  **Coronary artery flow**  
  *  Oxygen content of blood
  *  Oxygen extraction  


* Functionally, **coronary artery flow is the determinant**. This is because:
  * Oxygen content in individuals without pulmonary disease is maximal
  * Resting myocardial oxygen extraction is near-maximal (**~70%**)  
  This high ER makes the heart **less tolerant of anaemia** than organs with a low ER.


* Therefore coronary blood flow is the limiting factor  
  * Coronary blood flow is given by the equation:  
  $$CBF = {P_{Aortic \ Root} - P_{Cavity} \over Coronary \ Vascular \ Resistance}$$
    * Aortic *root* pressure is the driving pressure for coronary flow  
    * Cavity (ventricular) pressure acts as a **Starling resistor** for coronary flow  
      * Note that if RAP exceeds cavity pressure, RAP will be the pressure opposing coronary flow (due to downstream pressure at the coronary sinus)
   * Note that **cavity and aortic root pressure change throughout the cardiac cycle**, therefore:
     * The flow to each ventricle is different during the cardiac cycle
     * The left ventricle is **best perfused in diastole**  
     Therefore **heart rate** is an important determinant of coronary blood flow, as **tachycardia will decrease coronary blood flow**
* Flow to each ventricle is a function of how relationships change over the cardiac cycle

##Myocardial Oxygen Demand
Normal myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO<sub>2</sub>) is 21-27ml.min<sup>-1</sup>. The **three major determinants** are:
* **Heart rate**  
A change in heart rate will change the number of tension-generating cycles, causing a proportional change in MVO<sub>2</sub>.


* **Contractility**  
Refers to the **rate** of tension development as well as its **magnitude**. Changing $$\Delta P \over \Delta t \ $$ will change MVO<sub>2</sub>.


* **Ventricular wall tension**  
Ventricular wall tension is **pressure work**, or the work done by the ventricle to **generate pressure but not to eject volume**.
  * Wall tension is given by the **Law of LaPlace**  
  $$Wall \ Tension = {P.r \over 2}$$, where:
    * $$P$$ = Pressure during contraction
    * $$r$$ = Radius
 * Wall tension is therefore a function of:
   * **Afterload**  
   Increasing afterload will increase the pressure during contraction.
   * **Preload**  
   Increasing preload will increase radius, but to a **lesser extent than increasing afterload**.
     * This is because *volume* and *radius* are *not directly proportional*


**Minor determinants** of myocardial work are:
* **External work**  
External work can also be thought of as **volume work**, or the energy expended to eject blood from the ventricle.
  * This is encompassed by the area enclosed by the pressure-volume loop
    * Conversely, internal work is defined as the work required to change the shape of the ventricle and prepare it for ejection  
    On the pressure-volume loop internal work is represented by a triangle between the point of 0 pressure and volume, the end systolic point, and the beginning of rapid ventricular filling.
  * This is a minor determinant because the majority of ventricular work is generating the pressure required to eject blood, not actually move volume
  * External work is of greater importance at high CO
  * External work is used to calculate **cardiac efficiency**, given by the equation:  
  $$Cardiac \ Efficiency = {External \ Work \over \ Myocardial \ O_2 \ Consumption }$$


* **Basal oxygen consumption**   
Basal oxygen consumption (~8ml.min<sup>-1</sup>.100g<sup>-1</sup>) comprises ~25% of MVO<sub>2</sub>.
