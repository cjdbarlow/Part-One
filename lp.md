#Neuraxial Anatomy
> Describe the anatomy relevant to the performance of a lumbar puncture.

The spinal **epidural space** is:
* A space lying within the vertebral column, that contains:
	* Nerve roots
	* Vessels  
	Vascular density is greater anteriorly.
	* Fat
* A **negative pressure space**  
The epidural space is continuous with the paravertebral space, which is affected by changes in intrapleural pressure. As **intrapleural pressure** is usually **negative**, the epidural space is also a negative pressure space. This property facilitates the **hanging drop** technique of epidural placement. **Key exceptions** (and relative contraindications to hanging drop) include:
	* Positive pressure ventilation
	* Contractions in labour  
	Epidural veins are transfused by a contracting uterus, and pressure increases as they distend.
	* Valsalva maneuvre


The **intrathecal space** is:
* Deep to the epidural space  
* Contains the spinal cord and CSF

##Borders
The spinal **epidural space** is bordered:
* Anteriorly by the posterior longitudinal ligament
* Posteriorly by the ligamentum flavum
* Superiorly by the endosteal layer of dura  
Prevents passage of contents through the foramen magnum.
* Inferiorly by the sacrococcygeal membrane at the sacral hiatus
* Laterally by the pedicles and intervertebral foraminae



##Surface Anatomy
Identify:
* Spinous processes  
Generally palpable in midline.
	* C2 is the first palpable process
	* C7 is the most prominent process
	* T7 corresponds with the tip of the scapula when the arms are by the patients side
	* The line drawn across the iliac crest corresponds with thee L4/5 interspace in most patients  
	This is known as **Tuffer's Line**.
* Gluteal crease  
Identify midline in patients with impalpable spinous processes, who:
	* Are sitting flat
	* Do not have scoliosis


##Layers
Tissues passed through, from superficial to deep, include:
* Skin
* Subcutaneous tissue
* Supraspinous ligament  
One continuous ligament.
* Interspinous ligament  
One ligament between each spinous process.
* Ligamentum flavum  
This yellow ligament is:
	* Thicker and harder than other ligaments
	* Paired at each intervertebral level
	* 5-6mm thick in the adult, though it is thinner with:
		* Youth
		* ↑ Level
		* Body habitus
* Epidural space
* Dura
* Subarachnoid space
* Spinal cord  
Ends at L2 in adults and L3 in children.
