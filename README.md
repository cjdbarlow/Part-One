# Part One

Part One is a reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.

* Part One **is**:
    * Designed to cover the ***assessed*** sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula **in enough detail to pass**
    * A rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
    * A tool to correct your written answers
    * A source of information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
* Part One **is not**:
    * A textbook
    * The definitive guide to the primary exam
    * A complete reference
    There will be both omissions and errors. If you find any, please <a href="mailto:jake@jakebarlow.me?Subject=Part%20One" target="_top">let me know</a>.

## What is this? Where am I?

These are the source files for Part One. Content is written in Rmarkdown, which is a fusion of R, latex, and (Commonmark) markdown. The book is then built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Formatting of both HTML and PDF versions are heavily inspired by Edward Tufte - the theme has been ported from a previous custom-made [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) output format called Tufte in the Fast Lane (titfl).

Part One is a free and open access medical education (FOAMed) initiative, and is proudly part of Life in the Fast Lane. You can see the full site at [](partone.litfl.com).
