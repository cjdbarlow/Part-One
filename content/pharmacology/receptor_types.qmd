# Receptor Types

:::dual
To explain receptor activity with regard to: ionic fluxes, second messengers and G proteins, nucleic acid synthesis, evidence for the presence of receptors, regulation of receptor number and activity, structural relationships.

A receptor is a protein, usually in the cellular membrane, to which a ligand may bind to generate a response.

Key receptor types include:
* Intracellular 
* Enzyme-linked 
* Ion-channel
* G-protein coupled


## Intracellular Receptors

Intracellular receptors may be:

* **Cytoplasmic**
* **Intra-nuclear**\
Intranuclear receptors are activated by lipid soluble molecules (such as steroids and thyroxine) to alter DNA and RNA expression. This results in an alteration of production of cellular proteins, so the effects tend to be slow acting.


## Enzyme-linked Receptors

Enzyme-linked receptors are activated by a ligand and cause enzymatic activity on the intracellular side. They can be either:

* **Monomers**
* **Dimers**\
Where two proteins join, or diamerise, on binding of a ligand.


## Ion-channel Receptors

Ion-channel (ionotropic) receptors create a channel through the membrane that allows electrolytes to flow down their electrical and concentration gradients. They can be either:

* Ligand-gated
* Voltage-gated

### Ligand-gated Channels

Ligand-gated channels undergo a conformational change when a ligand is bound. There are three important families of ligand channels:

* Pentameric family\
Consist of five membrane spanning subunits. Include:
    * Nicotinic ACh receptor
    * GABA~A~ receptor
    * 5-HT~3~ receptor
    * Inotropic glutamate receptors\
    Bind glutamate, a CNS excitatory neurotransmitter. Include:
        * NMDA receptor\
        High Ca^2+^ permeability
* Inotropic purinergic receptors\
Form cationic channels that are permeable to Ca^2+^, Na^+^, and K^+^, and activated by ATP


### Voltage-gated Channels

Open when the **threshold voltage** is reached, facilitating electrical conduction in excitable tissues.

* In their normal physiological state, voltage gated channels do not generally behave as receptors for a ligand\
However some drugs (e.g. local anaesthetics) bind to voltage gated channels to exert their effect.
* Have a common 4-subunit structure (each with 6 transmembrane segments) surrounding a central pore\
This pore is selective for the particular ion, which include:
    * Na^+^
        * Located in myocytes and neurons
        * Important in generating and transmitting an action potential by permitting sodium influx into cells
        * Inhibited by local anaesthetics, anti-epileptics, and some anti-arrhythmics
    * Ca^2+^\
    Divided into subtypes, including:
        * L\
        Muscular contraction.
        * T\
        Cardiac pacemaker.
        * N/P/Q\
        Neurotransmitter release.
        * K^+^\
        Located in myocytes and important in repolarisation following an action potential.
* Undergo a conformational change when the threshold potential is reached\
This is sensed by the **S4 helix**, which acts to open and close the channel.
* Exist in one of three functional states:
    * Resting\
    Pore is closed.
    * Active\
    Pore is open, and ions can pass.
    * Inactive\
    Transient refractory period where the pore is open, but ions cannot pass. This creates the **absolute refractory period** of a cell.


## G-protein Coupled Receptors

G-proteins coupled (metabotropic) receptors are a group of **heterotrimeric** (containing three units; α, β, γ) proteins which bind GDP. When stimulated, the GDP is replaced by GTP and the α-GTP subunit dissociates to activate or inhibit an effector protein. The **effect depends** on the **type of α-subunit**:

* G~**s**~ proteins\
Are **stimulatory**. These
    * Increase cAMP, leading to a biochemical effect
* G~**i**~ proteins\
Are **inhibitory**. These:
    * Inhibit adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP
* G~q~ proteins\
Have a variable effect, depending on the cell. These:
    * Activate phospholipase C\
    This affects the production of:
        * Inositol triphosphate (IP~3~)\
        Stimulates Ca^2+^ from the SR, affecting enzymatic function or causing membrane depolarisation.
        * Diacylglycerol (DAG)  \
        Activates protein kinase C, which has cell-specific effects.
* Activate intracellular **second messenger proteins** when stimulated\
Second messenger systems:
    * Result in both transmission and **amplification** of a stimulus, as a single activated receptor can activate multiple proteins and each activated protein may activate several other intermediate proteins\
    This is known as a G-protein **cascade**.
