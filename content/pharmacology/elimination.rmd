# Elimination and Excretion

:::dual
Describe the mechanisms of drug clearance and how physiological and pathological disturbance may affect these
:::

**Elimination** is the **removal of drug from the plasma**, and includes distribution and metabolism, whilst **excretion** is the **removal of the drug from the body**. Excretion can occur via:

* **Urine**
* **Bile**
* Sweat
* Breast milk
* Tears
* Exhaled gas

## Renal Excretion

Renal excretion can occur via **two** mechanisms:

* Glomeruluar filtration\
Requires the drug is:
    * **Not protein bound**\
    Only free drug present in filtered plasma will be excreted.
        * Concentration of filtered drug will be the same as in *unfiltered* plasma
        * **Highly protein bound** drugs are **poorly filtered**\
        There is only a weak concentration gradient favouring dissociation from plasma proteins.
    * **Small**\
        * Substances less than 7,000 Da are freely filtered
        * Substances greater than 70,000 Da are essentially impermeable
    * **Hydrophilic/lipophobic**\
        Lipophilic drugs may be filtered at the glomerulus but will be freely reabsorbed during their passage down the tubule, such that only trivial amounts are eliminated in urine.
* Secreted in the tubules
    * **Active** process allows secretion **against concentration gradients**
    * Separate mechanisms for acidic and alkaline drugs
        * Saturatable process\
        Saturation may occur of a basic transporter whilst still allowing excretion of acidic drugs, and vice versa.

Renal elimination is **impaired** by tubular absorption, which occurs due to **passive diffusion** down a concentration gradient:

* Hydrophilic molecules can only be reabsorbed by a specialised transport mechanism
* Acidic drugs will be become ionised in an alkaline urine (and vice versa), reducing their solubility\
This is the physiological justification for urinary alkalinisation.

## Hepatic Excretion

Biliary elimination occurs for drugs unable to be filtered by the glomerulus. These are typically:

* Large\
Greater than 30,000 dalton.
* Lipid soluble

### Enterohepatic Recirculation

Drugs excreted in bile may:

* Be hydrolysed in the small bowel by bacteria and then reabsorbed
* Then pass through the portal circulation and get metabolised again
* This process may occur many times
