# Drug Interactions

:::dual
Classify and describe mechanisms of drug interaction.
:::

Drug interactions occur "when the action of one drug modifies that of another". Drug interactions may be:

* Physicochemical
* Pharmacokinetic
* Pharmacodynamic

## Physicochemical

::: column-margin
Thiopentone and suxamethonium precipitate out of solution if prepared together or delivered together in the same line
:::

Physicochemical interactions occur because of an incompatibility between chemical structures.

## Pharmacokinetic

Pharmacokinetic interactions can be sub-classified into those affecting:

* Absorption
* Distribution
* Metabolism
* Elimination.

### Absorption

For oral medications, absorption may be affected by drugs which alter:

::: column-margin
Metoclopramide is prokinetic and improves absorption of orally administered drugs
:::

* Gastric pH
* Gastric emptying time

### Distribution

Distribution may be affected by:

* Alteration of cardiac output::: column-margin
β-blockers reduce cardiac output and prolong the time to fasciculation of suxamethonium.
:::
* Competition for plasma protein binding^[Phenytoin is usually highly (90%) protein bound. A reduction in protein binding to 80% will double the free phenytoin level.\
\
For drugs with first-order kinetics, metabolism will increase proportionally however phenytoin rapidly saturates the enzyme system, leading to zero-order kinetics and a high plasma level.]\
Loss of albumin and α1-acid glycoprotein.
* Displacement from tissue binding sites\
This typically occurs due to alteration of metabolic capacity of one drug by the other.
* Chelation of drug from tissues\
Chelating agents bind toxic elements and prevent tissue damage

### Metabolism

Metabolism may be affected by changes to the CYP450 enzymes:

* Enzyme induction
    * Barbiturates
    * Phenytoin
    * Carbamazepine
* Enzyme inhibition
    * Amiodarone\
    Amiodarone inhibits metabolism of S-warfarin by CYP2C9, enhancing its effect.
    * Diltiazem
    * Verapamil
    * Ciprofloxacin
    * Macrolides
    * Metronidazole
    * Grapefruit juice


### Elimination

Renal elimination can be affected by:

::: column-margin
Sodium bicarbonate increases urinary pH and enhances excretion of weak acids such as aspirin.
:::

* Changes in urinary pH
* Competition for active tubular transport mechanisms


## Pharmacodynamic

Pharmacodynamic interactions can be **direct**, due to interaction on the same receptor system; or **indirect**, when they act on different receptor system. These interactions can be classified as either:

::: column-margin
**Examples**:\
Addition: Administering midazolam with propofol reduces the amount of propofol required to generate an effect.\
\
Antagonism: Neostigmine indirectly antagonises the effect of NDMRs by increasing the level of ACh at the NMJ\
\
Synergism: Co-administration of remifentanil and propofol has a synergistic effect in maintenance of anaesthesia
:::

* **Additive**\
When the effects summate.
* **Antagonistic**\
When the effects oppose each other.
* **Synergistic**\
When the combined effect is greater than would be expected from summation alone.

These three interactions can be graphically demonstrated using an **isobologram**, which draws a **line of equal activity** versus **concentration** of two drugs.
