Describe alterations to drug response due to pathological disturbance with particular reference to cardiac, respiratory, renal and hepatic disease
:::

There are four mechanisms which result in variable response to drug:

* Alteration in drug that reaches the receptor\
This is typically due to pharmacokinetic factors.
* Relative difference in presence of exogenous and endogenous ligands\
Antagonists will have a greater effect in the presence of high endogenous ligand concentration.
* Variation in receptor function and number\
Up-regulation and down-regulation of receptors may occur as a consequence of prolonged stimulus.
* Alteration in function distal to the receptor\

## Key Terms

* **Tachyphylaxis** is the **rapid decrease in response** to repeated dosing over a **short time period**, usually due to depletion of transmitter
* **Desensitisation** is the **loss in response** over a **long time period**, usually due to change in receptor morphology or loss in receptor numbers
* **Withdrawal** is a pathological response when a drug is ceased\
    * During administration receptors may be:
        * **Up-regulated** in the continued presence of an antagonist\
        * **Down-regulated** in the continued presence of an agonist
    * Loss of receptor numbers may precipitate withdrawal when the agonist or antagonist is ceased
* **Addiction** is a behavioural pattern characterised by compulsive use and fixation on acquiring and using a drug
* **Idiosyncrasy** is an individual patient response to a drug\
Typically mediated by a reactive metabolite rather than the drug itself.


## Tolerance

**Tolerance** is the requirement for a **larger dose** to achieve the **same effect**, due to altered sensitivity of the receptors to the stimulant. Can be either:

* Pharmacokinetic tolerance
* Pharmacodynamic dynamic tolerance

### Pharmacokinetic Tolerance

Occurs via:

* **Altered drug metabolism**\
Metabolism may be **increased or decreased**:\
    * Enzymatic induction and increased drug metabolism\
    Increased hepatic enzyme pathway capacity increases metabolism and lowers plasma concentration.
    * Decreased metabolism\
    Decreased metabolism of a prodrug can result in a reduced effect.


### Pharmacodynamic Tolerance

Occurs via:

* **Change in receptor morphology**\
Can occur with ion-channel receptors and GPCRs:\
    * Ion-channel receptors bind the ligand but do not open the channel
    * GPCR become 'uncoupled' - phosphorylation of the receptor makes it unable to activate second messenger cascade, though it can still bind the ligand.
* **Receptor down-regulation**\
Prolonged exposure to agonists causes transmembrane (typically hormone) receptors to become **internalised**. This occurs more slowly than uncoupling.
* **Receptor up-regulation**\
Prolonged exposure to antagonists causes an up-regulation of receptor.
    * Can lead to rebound effects when a drug is ceased (e.g. hypertension with cessation of clonidine)
* **Exhaustion of mediators**\
Similar to tachyphylaxis - depletion of a mediating substance decreases the effect.
* **Physiological adaptation**\
Actions of a drug may be countered by a compensatory homeostatic response.
* **Active removal of the drug from the cell**

## Patient Factors Affecting Drug Response

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are affected in:

* Pregnancy
* Extremes of age
    * Foetus
    * Neonate
    * Elderly
* Other

### Pregnancy

**Pharmacokinetic**:

* **Absorption**
    * Decreased gastric emptying
    * Nausea and vomiting
    * Increased cardiac output
        * Increases IM and SC absorption
    * Volatiles:
        * Increased onset due to increased MV and reduced FRC
        * Decreased onset due to increased CO
* **Distribution**
    * Increased V~D~ due to:
        * Increased TBW
        * Increased plasma volume
        * Increased fat mass
    * Decreased albumin and α~1~-glycoprotein
* **Metabolism**
    * No change to HBF
    * Progesterone induces enzymes
    * Oestrogen competes for enzymes
    * Decreased plasma cholinesterase activity
* **Elimination**
    * Increased RBF
    * Increased GFR

**Pharmacodynamic**:

* Decreased MAC
* Increased LA sensitivity due to decreased α~1~-glycoprotein

### Foetus

:::info
Drugs that cross the placenta can be teratogenic to the foetus, besides exerting their usual pharmacological effects.
:::

`r tufte::margin_note("A teratogen is a drug which adversely affects foetal development. Teratogens have diverse mechanisms that are not well understood")`

**Pharmacokinetic** factors predominantly **affect placental transfer**, and include:

* **Lipid solubility**\
Lipid soluble drugs diffuse more rapidly.
* **Molecular size**\
Drugs with a molecular weight >1000 dalton cross the placenta slowly.
* **Protein binding**
* **Placental transporters**\
Some medications are actively removed from foetal circulation.
* **Placental metabolism**\
The placenta can metabolise some medications, although in some cases results in toxic metabolites.

Maternal **pharmacodynamic** factors predominantly affect the uterus and breast; **major organ systems** are **not significantly affected**.

### Neonates

At < 1 year of age, pharmacokinetics are significantly altered:

* **Absorption**
    * Delayed gastric emptying, increasing absorption of drugs metabolised in the stomach
    * Decreased secretion of pancreatic enzymes and bile salts impairs absorption of lipid soluble medications
    * Smaller muscle mass and higher relative muscle blood flow increases IM onset
    * Increased V~A~:FRC ratio increases onset of volatiles
* **Distribution**
    * TBW is 70-75% (compared to 50-60% for an adult), and extracellular water is 40% (compared to 20%), which typically **increases V~D~**
    * Preterm infants have reduced body fat
    * Greater proportion of cardiac output goes to head, increasing onset of centrally acting (e.g. anaesthetic) drugs
    * Decreased albumin and α~1~-glycoprotein
    * Immature BBB increases uptake of partially ionised drugs
* **Metabolism**\
    * Enzymatic capacity of all pathways is reduced, which prolongs elimination half-lives and reduces clearance.
        * Hepatically metabolised drugs must be dose adjusted accordingly
    * The glucuronide pathway may not mature until age 4
* **Excretion**\
    * **GFR is proportionally lower** and dose not reach adult equivalence until 6-12 months
        * GFR is **further reduced** in **pre-term** infants
        * GFR is increased in **1-3 year** olds


**Pharmacodynamic** considerations:

* Smaller ACh reserves increase sensitivity to NMBs
* Increased MAC but more rapid onset
* NSAIDs cause closures of ductus arteriosus

### Elderly

:::info
Though there is a linear decrease in functional capacity of major systems beginning at 45, alterations are predominantly a consequence of polypharmacy and subsequent drug interactions.
:::

**Pharmacokinetic**:

* **Absorption**
    * Laxatives and prokinetic increase gastric emptying and reduce absorption of oral agents
* **Distribution**
    * There is a proportional increase in fat\
    * There is a proportional decrease in:
        * Lean body mass
        * Total body water
        * Albumin
* **Metabolism**
    * ↓ Hepatic blood flow 
    * ↓ Enzymatic activity\
    Phase I > Phase II.
* **Elimination**
    * Loss of nephron number with age reduces renal clearance


**Pharmacodynamic**:

* Increased sensitivity to sedatives, opioids, and hypnotics
* Decreased sensitivity to β-agonists and antagonists
* Decreased MAC
* Polypharmacy increases potential for drug interactions


## Disease Factors Affecting Drug Response

    * Increased plasma and tissue esterase levels
    * Normal or increased hepatic enzymes
* **Elimination**
    * Increased renal clearance due to increased CO


### Non-Specific Alterations to Drug Response

**Pharmacokinetic**:

* **Absorption**:
    * Site of administration\
    Drugs given centrally will act faster than those given into peripheral veins.
    * Rate of administration\
    Faster rate of administration will increase rate of onset.


**Pharmacodynamic**:

* Drug tolerance
Increase requirement of drug.
    * e.g. induction anaesthetic agents in patients tolerant to CNS depressants.
* Drug interaction\
May be:
    * Synergistic
    * Additive
    * Antagonistic
