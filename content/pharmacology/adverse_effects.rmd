Describe the mechanisms of adverse drug effects
:::

An **adverse effect** is:

* A noxious or unintended effect associated with administration of a drug at the **normal dose** (i.e., not an overdose)\
Occur:
    * Mainly in young and middle-aged individuals
    * Twice as common in women
    * May be exacerbated by asthma and pregnancy.
* Distinct from an **adverse event**, which is an untoward occurrence during treatment that does not necessarily have a causal relationship to drug administration

Adverse effects can be classified by mechanism as follows:

## Type A Adverse Reactions

These are related to the pharmacological action of the drug. They are:

* Common
* Related to dose (dose-response relationship)
* Temporally associated with drug administration
* Reproducible
* Pharmacologically predictable based on understanding of the drug in question
    * e.g hypokalaemia secondary to diuretic use

They typically result in:

* Organ-selective injury
* More pronounced with long-term use and in risk groups:
    * Extremes of age
    * Pregnancy
    * Renal failure
* High morbidity but low mortality\
Treatment is to decrease dose.

## Type B Adverse Reactions

These are patient-specific or idiosyncratic reactions. They are:

* Rare\
  Potentially genetic, but poorly understood.
* Independent of dose\
    * Occur with low doses
    * Do not have a dose-response relationship
* Not pharmacologically predictable\
Important causes include:
    * Acetylator status
    * CYP450 variants
    * Receptor abnormalities
    * Enzyme alterations/deficiencies\
        * e.g. Suxamethonium apnoea
* Not necessarily reproducible

They typically result in:

* Immuno-allergic reactions
* Pseudo-allergy
* Idiosyncratic reaction
* Low morbidity but high mortality
    * e.g. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome or anaphylaxis following penicillin administration

The treatment is to cease the medication.

## Type C Adverse Reactions

These are 'statistical effects' associated with monitoring. They are:

* Typically an increased frequency of background disease that is detected due to increased screening
* Atypical for a drug reaction and not pharmacological predictable
* No identifiable temporal relationship
* Not reproducible
