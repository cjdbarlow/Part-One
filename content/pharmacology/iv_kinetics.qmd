## Continuous Infusions

Plasma concentrations of an IV infusion are influenced by both pharmacokinetics and the method of infusion. In absence of a loading dose, the **concentration** of **drug infused at a constant rate** increases in a **negative exponential fashion**:

* Plasma concentration initially rises rapidly
* **Distribution** into peripheral compartments is the **main method** for drugs to **leave plasma**\
At the start of an infusion there is a large concentration gradient between plasma and peripheral compartments. As peripheral compartments fill the concentration gradient between plasma and compartments falls, and redistribution becomes relatively less important.
* Excretion has a greater effect on plasma concentration in prolonged infusions
* **Steady state** is achieved when **concentrations in compartments are equal**, **and input is equivalent to clearance**\
    * Concentration at steady state is determined by the ratio of infusion rate to clearance: $C = {Infusion \ Rate \over Clearance}$
        * Therefore, at steady state with drugs with 100% bioavailability:\
        $Infusion \ Rate = C_{target}.Cl$\
        * For drugs given by a route with less than 100% bioavailability:\
        $Route \ Dosing \ Rate  = {Cld.C_{target} \over Bioavailability }$
        * If the dosing is given intermittently, then:\
        $Dosing \ Rate = Dose.Dose \ Interval$
    * **Volume of distribution** at **steady state** is termed **V~D~ss**\
    This is the apparent volume into which a drug will disperse during a prolonged infusion, and is the sum of all compartment volumes in the model.

#### Continuous Rate Infusions with Bolus Dosing

As seen, above starting an infusion at the rate required to maintain steady state is inefficient:

* For any desired plasma concentration, it will take three time constants (4-5 half-lives) for a continuous infusion to reach this concentration
    * If the half-life is long, then achieving a therapeutic level will take some time
* A bolus dose aimed to fill the V~D~ will allow steady-state to be reached immediately: $Loading \ dose = V_D.C_{target}$

## Stopping an Infusion

For a bi-exponential model (i.e. only one peripheral compartment), decline in plasma concentration can be modeled by the equation $C = Ae^{- \alpha t} + Be^{- \beta t}$. In this model:

* $\alpha$ is the time-constant for redistribution\
* $\beta$ is the time-constant for **terminal elimination**\
(Provided the infusion has reached steady-state).
* Neither $\alpha$ or $\beta$ correspond to any individual rate constant

Factors affecting rate of offset of an infusion can be classified into pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other drug factors:

* **Pharmacokinetic factors**
  * Distribution
    * **V~D~**\
    High V~D~ will decrease clearance from central compartment. Factors affecting V~D~ include:
      * Ionisation\
      Ion trapping can cause drug to be sequestered.
      * Protein binding\
      * Lipid solubility\
      Affected by body fat.
    * Speed of distribution\
      * CO\
      Affects organ blood flow.
    * **Redistribution**\
    During an infusion, peripheral compartments become saturated with drug. When an infusion ceases, drug is redistributed central compartment.
      * This is related to **context-sensitive half time** (see below)
  * Metabolism
    * Route of clearance\
      * Organ-dependent
        * Organ failures
        * Extraction ratio
        * Organ blood flow
      * Organ-independent
      * Saturatable kinetics\
      Zero-order kinetics.
    * Presence of active metabolites
  * Elimination\
  Route of excretion of active drug or active metabolites.
    * Organ failures
* **Pharmacodynamic Factors**
  * Age\
    * Sensitivity\
    Dose required for effect and dose required for recovery.
  * Organ failures
  * Pregnancy
* **Other drug factors**\
  * Pharmacokinetic interactions
    * Enzyme inhibition/induction
  * Pharmacodynamic interaction
    * Drug tolerances
      * Tachyphylaxis
  * Drug action\
  Drugs which alter gene or receptor expression, or bind irreversibly (e.g. clopidogrel) may show ongoing effects even after the drug has left the system.

### Context-Sensitive Half-Time

**Context-sensitive half time** is the **time taken for plasma concentration to decrease by 50% after discontinuation of an infusion.** The CSHT is:

* A method to describe the variability in plasma concentrations after ceasing an infusion\
The "**context**" is the **duration of infusion**.
* Used because terminal elimination half-life has little clinical utility for predicting drug offset\
Half-lives are often misleading when discussing drug infusions.
* Dependent on both the:
  * **Duration** of the **infusion**\
  During an infusion, drugs distribute out of plasma into tissues. When the infusion ceases, drug is cleared from plasma and tissue drug redistributes back into plasma.
    * The longer an infusion, the more drug has distributed out of tissues, and the longer the redistribution phase
    * The longest context-sensitive half time occurs when an infusion is at steady-state
  * Extent of **Redistribution**\
  The maximal CSHT reached depends on the:
    * **V~D~ss**\
    Drugs with a larger V~D~ss have a longer CSHT, as only a small proportion of the drug in the body will be in plasma and able to be cleared.
    * **Rate constant for elimination**\
    Drugs with a smaller rate constant for elimination have a longer CSHT.

Drugs with a longer context-sensitive half-times will wear off less predictably^[Remifentanil has little redistribution and a small V~D~, and so has a very short context-**in**sensitive half time. It wears off reliably and quickly following cessation of infusion.].

### Context-Sensitive Decrement Time

The context-sensitive decrement time:

* Describes the **time taken** for a **drug level** to **fall to a particular percentage of its starting value**^[The context-sensitive half-time could also be described as the 50% context-sensitive decrement time.] after discontinuation of an infusion
* Is used because the half-time does not describe **mono-exponential decay**\
i.e. The time taken for drug concentration to reach 25% of its starting value is not twice the context sensitive half-time.
