The Therapeutic Goods Administration classifies drugs for suitability in pregnancy based on the potential of a drug to cause:

* Birth defects
* Detrimental effects at birth

The classification system is:

* Valid only for the dose and route of administration listed
    * Does not apply in overdose
* Not hierarchical
    * 'B' drugs are not safer than 'C' drugs

## Categories

    * Category B1\
    Animal studies show no evidence of detrimental effect to the foetus.
    * Category B2\
    Animal studies are inadequate or lacking, but available data shows no evidence of detrimental effect to the foetus.

    Animal studies show evidence of foetal damage, but the significance of this in humans is unknown.
* **Category C**\
    * Drugs which have caused (or a suspected to cause) detrimental foetal effects, but without malformations
    * These effects may be reversible
* **Category D**
    * Drugs which have caused (or are suspected to cause) an increased incidence of foetal malformations or damage
