# Additives

:::CICM
Describe the pharmaceutics and formulation of drugs including ~~packaging, formulation, isomerism, compatibility~~ and excipients (additives) as they pertain to drugs
:::

Additives are **components of a drug preparation** which **do not exert** the **pharmacological effect**. They include:

* **Preservatives**
    * Benzyl alcohol
        * Antimicrobial when > 2%
        * Can be used as a solvent when > 5%
        * Toxic
* **Antioxidants**
    * Sulfites
        * Hypersensitivity
        * Neurotoxic if given intrathecally
* **Solvents**
    * Water\
    Appropriate for dissolving polar molecules.
    * Non-aqueous solvents\
    Used to dissolve non-polar molecules, or to produce more stable preparations of semi-polar molecules. Examples include:
        * Propylene glycol
            * Hypotension
            * Arrhythmia\
            With rapid injection.
            * Pain on injection
            * Thrombophlebitis
        * Mannitol
            * Diuresis
        * Soybean oil
            * Pain on injection
            * Allergy
* **Emulsion**\
Formed when drops of a liquid are dispersed throughout another liquid in which it is immiscible. Emulsions are:
    * Unstable\
    Emulsifiers are used to enhance stability.
    * Prone to contamination\
    Due to the water component.
    * Prone to rancidity\
    Due to the oil component.
* **Buffers**\
Maintain pH in a particular range in order to:
    * Maximise stability\
    Preserve shelf life.
    * Maintain solubility
    * Maximise preservative function
