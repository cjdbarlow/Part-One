**Pharmacokinetics** describes **what the body does to a drug**. 

## Volume of Distribution (V~D~)

The volume of distribution is defined as the **theoretical volume into which an amount of drug would be distribute to produce the observed plasma concentration**.
$$Vd = {Total \ bioavailable \ drug \over Plasma \ concentration }$$

Properties:

* Units are ml.kg^-1^ 
* Describes what proportion of a drug is confined to plasma, and what proportion distributes to other tissues\
It does not correspond to any particular volume, however a V~D~ of:
    * Less than 40ml.kg^-1^ indicates a drug is confined to plasma
    * Up to 200ml.kg^-1^ indicates a drug is confined to the ECF
    * Up to 600ml.kg^-1^ indicates a drug is dissolved into the TBW
    * Greater than 1L.kg^-1^ indicates a drug is highly protein bound or lipophilic\
    Agents which cross the blood brain barrier typically have a V~D~ of 1-2L.kg^-1^.
* Subtypes of the volume of distribution are used to describe drug distribution at different times or with different models
    * These include:
        * V~1~\
        Volume of central compartment.
        * V~D~ss\
        Volume of distribution at steady state.
        * V~D~pe\
        Volume of distribution at peak effect.
    * Which V~D~ to use depends on the pharmacological question  
    e.g. Intubating dose for opioid should use the V~D~pe as it will allow a target concentration to be selected for the time at which intubation will occur relative to drug administration
* Affected by changes in total-body water


### Significance of the Volume of Distribution

Allows calculation of:

* **Expected drug concentration**s produced by a given dose\
Both in plasma, as well as in target sites.
* **Loading dose**s


## Half-life

The half-life (t~1/2~) is **the time it takes for a process to be 50% complete**^[The formula for half-life can be derived from the equation for a wash-in exponential.\
\
1. Wash in exponential is given by: $C = 1 - e^{-kt}$\
\
2. $y = 0.5$ can then be substituted and the equation solved for $t$:\
$\begin{aligned}
0.5 &= 1 - e^{-kt} \\
 -0.5 &= e^{-kt} \\
\ln-0.5 &= -kt \\
\ln 2 &= kt \\
{\ln 2 \over k} &= t \\
{0.693 \over k} &= t
\end{aligned}$].

* With respect to drug clearance, it is the time it takes for concentration (typically in plasma) to fall by 50%
* A **process** is considered to be **complete after 4-5 half-lives**\
    * As the value decreases by 50% after each half-life, so **after 5 half-lives** concentration will be **3.125% of its starting value**
    * This also applies to wash in - it will take ~4-5 elimination half-lives of a drug for a constant-rate infusion to reach its final concentration


Various types of half-life are described:

* t~1/2~α describes the rapidity of the distribution phase following drug administration
* t~1/2~β describes the rapidity of the *elimination* phase occurring after drug distribution equilibrium\
This only evaluates clearance from plasma, and so is a composite of both excretion from the body (e.g. renal and hepatic clearance) and ongoing distribution to peripheral tissues.
    * The elimination half-life is generally not useful to predict drug offset, as this is affected by many factors\
    However, it does set an **upper limit** on how long it will take plasma concentration to fall by 50%.


Half-life is mathematically related to many other key pharmacokinetic terms.

$t_{1/2} = 0.693 \times \tau = {0.693 \over k} = {0.693 \times V_D \over Cl}$

Where:

* $\tau$ is the time constant
* $k$ is the rate constant for elimination
* $V_D$ is the volume of distribution
* $Cl$ is the clearance


### Significance of Half-Life

Half-life determines:

:::column-margin
Note that complete drug elimination is also another form of steady-state - both are achieved after **3-5× half-lives**.
:::

* The time taken:
    * To achieve **steady state**\
    Drugs with very long half-lives often require loading doses for this reason, as otherwise achieving an effective plasma concentration may take days-weeks.
    * For drug elimination
* **Dosing intervals**\
If a drug is given:
    * Every half-life, the plasma concentration will fluctuate two-fold over the dosing interval
    * More frequently than one half-life, the peaks and troughs will be less than two-fold
    * Less frequently than one half-life, greater fluctuation will occur

:::column-margin
The significance of fluctuating drug levels is drug dependent. How much half-life affects dosing therefore depends on how much drug level affects:

* Clinical efficacy
* Toxicity
:::



## Time Constant ($\tau$)

The time constant is the **time taken for a process to complete if it continued at its initial rate of change**. Time constants are similar to the half-life, but are **better suited when modeling** change in **exponential processes**.

::: column-margin
Time constants are discussed in more detail under respiratory @sec-timeconstant .
:::

* Elimination will be virtually complete after three time constants
* A time constant is the **inverse of the rate constant for elimination**, i.e. $\tau = {1 \over k }$

## Clearance and Rate of Elimination

Clearance describes the elimination of drug from the body. Clearance is the **volume of plasma completely cleared of a drug per unit time** measured in ml.min^-1^. Clearance:

* Does not include redistribution
* Is calculated from the area under the concentration time curve: $Cl = {Dose \over AUC}$
* Is the sum of drug clearances from each organ

The **rate of elimination** is the **amount of drug removed by the body** per unit time, and is:

* The product of the clearance and the current concentration: $Rate \ of \ Elimination = Cl \times C$, in mg.min^-1^
* *Not* the same as clearance
* Also **not** the same as the rate *constant* for elimination

### Significance of Clearance

Clearance determines the **maintenance dose required** to achieve **steady-state**.

### Total Clearance

Total clearance is the sum of clearances from individual organs, e.g.:

* $Cl_{total} = Cl_{renal} + Cl_{liver} + Cl_{lung} + Cl_{organ \ independent} + Cl_{other}$, where:
    * $Cl_{renal} = {[U] \times V \over [P]}$, where:
    * $[U]$ is urine concentration in mmol.L^-1^, a function of glomerular filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.
    * $V$ is the urine flow in ml.min^-1^
    * $[P]$ is the plasma concentration in mmol.L^-1^
  * $Cl_{hepatic} = HBF \times ER_{liver}$, where:
    * $HBF$ is the hepatic blood flow in ml.min^-1^
    * $ER$ is the extraction ratio (see below)

:::column-margin
Generally, total clearance is equivalent to the sum of hepatic (via metabolism to inactive metabolite, or biliary clearance), and renal (in urine) clearance.
:::

In a one compartment model, total clearance can be expressed as either:

::: column-margin
Since $k$ and $V_D$ are constants, clearance is also a constant.
:::

* $Cl = k.V_D$ in ml.min^-1^, or: 
* $Cl = {V_D \over \tau } = {0.693 \times V_D \over t_{1/2}}$\
This uses the property that $\tau = {1 \over k}$.

### Clearance Kinetics

Drug clearance can follow either first order or zero-order kinetics:

::: column-margin
First-order kinetics: <img src="/resources/first-order-kinetics.svg">
:::

* **First-order Kinetics**\
A constant **proportion** of the drug in the body is eliminated per unit time.
    * Most drugs are eliminated by first order kinetics, as the capacity of the elimination system exceeds the concentration of drug

::: column-margin
Zero-order kinetics: <img src="/resources/zero-order-kinetics.svg">
:::

* **Zero-order kinetics**\
A **constant amount of drug** is eliminated per unit time, independent of how much drug is in the body.
    * Occurs when there is saturation of enzyme systems\
    It is also known as **saturation kinetics** for this reason.
        * e.g. Phenytoin follows first order kinetics at lower doses, but zero-order kinetics at doses within the therapeutic range\
        This is clinically relevant as the narrow therapeutic index means that toxic levels may occur rapidly with a small increase in dose.
        * e.g. Ethanol also follows zero-order kinetics within the "therapeutic range", as it is a very weak (doses are in grams) positive allosteric modulator of the GABA~A~ receptor
    * Zero-order kinetics is concerning as:
        * Plasma concentrations will **rapidly increase** with only modest dose increase
        * There is essentially **no steady state**: if drug input exceeds output, plasma levels will continue to rise


### Michaelis-Menten

The Michaelis-Menten equation describes the transition from first order to zero order kinetics as drug concentration increases:

* Metabolism increases proportionally with concentration as long as the concentration of drug leaving the organ of metabolism (e.g. in the hepatic vein) is less than half of the maximal concentration of drug that organ can metabolise
* This is usually ~1/3^rd^ of the maximal rate of metabolism
