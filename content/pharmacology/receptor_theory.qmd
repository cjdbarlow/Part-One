# Receptor Theory {#sec-receptortheory}

:::dual
To explain the concept of drug action with respect to: receptor theory\
\
To define and explain dose-effect relationships of drugs, including dose-response curves with reference to: graded and quantal response, therapeutic index, potency and efficacy, competitive and non-competitive antagonists, partial agonists, mixed agonist-antagonists and inverse agonists\
\
To explain the Law of Mass Action and describe affinity and dissociation constants
:::

A **receptor** is a component of a cell which interacts with a drug and **initiates a sequence of events leading to an observed change in function**.

* Existence of receptors is inferred from the response of tissues to drugs, genome sequencing, and molecular biology.
* A drug binds to a receptor forming a **receptor-drug complex**, which initiates a cascade of events to exert a pharmacological effect. 

## Dissociation Constants

Interaction between a receptor and a drug is based upon the **law of mass action**, which states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the masses of reacting substances. This can be expressed as:

$[Drug] + [Receptor] \Leftrightarrow [Drug-Receptor]$


The ratio of the **rate constant** for the forwards reaction (formation of the drug-receptor complex, **K~association~**) and the backwards reaction (dissolution of the drug-receptor complex to individual drug and receptor components, **K~dissociation~**) is the **dissociation constant**:

* This is the concentration of drug when 50% of receptors are occupied: $K_D = {[D][R] \over [D-R]}$
* A **low K~D~** value indicates that a lower concentration of drug is required to occupy 50% of the receptor, indicating that the drug has a **high affinity** for the receptor

Physiological factors which affect the dissociation constant are determined by the **Arrhenius equation**, $k = Ae^{-E_A \over RT}$, where:

* $A$ is a constant
* $T$ is **temperature** in kelvin
* $E_A$ is the activation energy required, which may be lowered by a **catalyst**
* $R$ is the gas constant

## Properties of Drugs in Receptor Theory

Key properties of drugs include:

* **Potency**\
The **amount** of drug required to achieve a given effect.
    * Typically expressed by the E~D~50
* **Efficacy**\
The **maximal** effect that a drug can generate.
* **Intrinsic activity** (activity)\
The size of effect a drug has when bound, which is graded from 0 to 1. 


## Drug-Receptor Interactions

Drugs can be classified by the way they interact with receptors into:

::: column-margin
<img src="/resources/agonists-FA-IA-PA.svg">
:::

* **Agonists**
    * Partial agonists
    * Inverse agonists
* **Antagonists**
    * Indirect antagonists
* **Mixed Agonist-Antagonists**
* **Allosteric Modulators**

### Agonists

An agonist will generate a **maximal** response at the receptor site. An agonist has **high affinity** and an **activity of 1**. Agonists can be compared by:

* **Relative potency**  
If two agonists are equally *efficacious*, the more *potent* one requires a **smaller dose** to achieve an effect.
* **Relative efficacy**  
The agonist with greater relative efficacy can achieve a greater *maximal effect*.




### Partial Agonist

A partial agonist:

* Generates a **submaximal** response at the receptor
* Has **high affinity** and an **activity between 0 and 1**
* Can act as an effective antagonist in the presence of a full agonist, as it will prevent maximal binding at a receptor, even with a high agonist concentration

### Inverse Agonist 

A drug which has a **negative activity** (between 0 and -1) producing the **opposite** response (compared to the endogenous agonist) at receptor. This occurs due to loss of **constitutive activity** at that receptor.

### Antagonist

An antagonist produces no response at the receptor site, and prevents other ligands binding. Antagonists have **high affinity** and an **activity of 0**.

Antagonists with these properties are also known as **direct antagonists**, and can be either:

<img src="/resources/FA-with-nca-and-ca.svg">
:::


* **Competitive antagonists**\
Displace other ligands from a binding site. Competitive antagonists can be:
    * Reversible\
    The effect **can be overridden** by increasing the dose of agonist.
    * Irreversible\
    Drug **cannot be overridden** by increasing dose of agonist. Dose-response curve appears similar to that of the non-competitive antagonist.
* **Non-competitive antagonists**\
Create a conformational change in the receptor. They **cannot be overridden** by increasing the dose of agonist.



### Indirect Antagonist

Indirect antagonists reduce the clinical effect of a drug, but do so via means other than receptor interaction. They include:

* **Chemical antagonists**\
Where the drug binds directly to another. Examples include protamine and heparin, and sugammadex and rocuronium.
* **Physiologic antagonists**\
A countering effect is produced by agonism of other pathways.

### Mixed Agonist-Antagonist

A drug which has may act as either agonist or antagonist, depending on the receptor.

## Allosteric Modulator

A drug which binds to an allosteric site on the receptor and produces conformational change that alters the affinity of the receptor for the endogenous agonist.

Allosteric modulators can be:

* Positive\
Increases affinity for endogenous agonist.
    * e.g. Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators at the GABA~A~ receptor
* Negative\
Decreases affinity for endogenous agonist.
