# Distribution

:::dual
Describe factors influencing the distribution of drugs (for example, protein binding, lipid solubility, pH, pKa) and their alteration in physiological and pathological disturbance
:::

Drug distribution is dependent on many factors, which can be subdivided^[This approach is fundamentally an abstraction of Fick's Law that aligns neatly with both pharmacological properties and the principles of flashcard design.\
\
If you get lost, remember Fick's Law:\
$\dot{V} = {A \times D \times \Delta P \over T}$
Where:\
- $A$ = Area for diffusion (regional blood flow)\
- $D$ = Diffusion constant (solubility, ionisation, molecular weight, pH, pKa)\
- $\Delta P$ = Concentration gradient (dose, method, tissue mass, protein binding)\
- $T$ = Thickness of diffusion membrane] into:

* Diffusion characteristics
* Protein binding
* Regional blood flow


## Diffusion Characteristics

Diffusion of drugs to tissues is a function of the:

* **Concentration gradient**\
Increasing the concentration of drug will increase the rate it distributes into tissues. This is affected by:
    * Dose
    * Method of administration\
    Bolus, infusion.
    * Tissue mass\
    Lower mass results in a more rapid rise in concentration and a subsequent reduction in speed of distribution.
* **Molecular Weight**\
Larger molecules are less able to cross cell membranes, and so a greater portion will remain in the compartment they are delivered to.
* **Lipid Solubility** and **Ionisation**\
Ionised drugs are polar, and so are less lipid soluble.
    * Ionisation is a function of:
        * pKa\
        The pKa is the pH at which a weak acid or weak base will be 50% ionised.
            * As solvent pH changes, the proportion of ionised vs. unionised drug will differ\
            * How depends on whether the drug is an acid or base:
                * **B**ases are ionised **B**elow their pKa^[Ionisation of bases: <img src="resources/pkas-bases.svg">]
                * **A**cids are ionised **A**bove their pKa^[Ionisation of acids: <img src="resources/pkas-acids.svg">]
        * pH\
        In combination with pKa, affects the ionised portion.
    * Unionised drugs:
        * Cross cell membranes more readily than the ionised form
        * Are typically hepatic metabolised
        * Are typically not renally eliminated
    * Ionised drugs:
        * Are typically renally excreted without undergoing metabolism
        * Are poorly lipid soluble and do not cross cell membranes readily
        * May be ion trapped\
        This occurs when an unionised drug moves across a membrane and becomes ionised due to a change in pH. The now-insoluble drug is trapped in the new compartment. This is relevant in the:
            * Placenta\
            Foetal pH is lower than maternal pH, which can trap basic drugs (e.g. LA, opioids) in foetus. This effect becomes more significant with a greater divergence of pH (e.g. in placental insufficiency).
            * Kidney\
            Urinary alkalinisation is used to accelerate elimination of acidic drugs, as they become ionised and trapped in urine.



## Protein Binding

Proteins and drugs may be bound together by weak bonds. These include ionic bonds, van der Waal's forces, and hydrogen bonds. Protein binding is important as only unbound drugs can:

* Cross cell membranes
* Interact with receptors
* Undergo metabolism\
Reduced protein binding increases clearance of drugs with low **extraction ratios**.
* Be filtered by the glomerulus

Protein binding may occur in:

* Plasma
    * **Albumin**\
    Binds acid and neutral drugs.
        * High capacity
        * Two major binding sites (six total)
            * Site I (warfarin)
            * Site II (diazepam)
    * **α1-acid glycoprotein**\
     Binds basic drugs.
        * Single binding site
        * Low capacity\
        Typically results in lower total binding (compared to albumin) of alkaline drugs, despite its increased affinity.
    * Lipoprotein\
    For lipid soluble drugs.
* Tissues
* Receptors


Protein binding is affected by:

* Affinity of drug for protein
    * Ionised drugs do not bind to protein\
    pH.
    * Competition between drugs for binding sites
* Amount of protein
    * Disease\
    Due to:
        * Hypoalbuminaemia\
        Negative acute phase reactant.
        * Increased α1-acid glycoprotein\
        Acute phase reactant.
    * Pregnancy
        * Decreased α1-acid glycoprotein
    * Competition\
  Source of pharmacokinetic interactions.


Therefore, **highly tissue bound drugs**:

* Have a **long duration** of action
* Have a **high V~D~**, prolonging their elimination\
* May **build up in tissues**, leading to adverse effects\
e.g. Corneal deposition, lung fibrosis.


Protein binding *typically*:

* Correlates with lipid solubility
* Is important only when it is very high
* Results in a decreased V~Dss~ when plasma binding is high
* Results in an increased V~Dss~ when tissue binding is high
* Is important in duration of action as it also relates to affinity for *tissue* proteins



## Regional Blood Flow

Regional blood flow affects concentration gradients between blood and tissue, and is affected by cardiac output. Regions include:

* Vessel Rich Group
    * Brain
    * Heart
    * Liver
    * Kidneys
* Vessel Poor Group\
Connective tissues:
    * Bones
    * Ligament
    * Teeth
    * Hair
    * Muscle groups
    * Fat
