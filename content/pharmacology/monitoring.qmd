# Drug Monitoring

:::dual
Explain clinical drug monitoring with regard to peak and trough concentrations, minimum therapeutic concentration and toxicity
:::

Drug monitoring describes the individualisation of dosing by maintaining plasma drug levels within a target range. Drug monitoring is indicated to:

* Avoid **toxicity**
* Adjust dosing for **efficacy**
* Monitor **compliance**
* Account for **high inter-patient variability** in response\
Variability can be:
    * Pharmacokinetic\
    Adjusting drug dose by monitoring plasma levels reduces pharmacokinetic variability.
    * Pharmacodynamic\
    Drug dose is adjusted by evaluating the clinical effect. 


## Therapeutic Index

The **therapeutic index** is:

* $Therapeutic \ Index = {LD_{50} \over ED_{50}}$, where:
    * **ED~50~**\
    The dose required to produce the minimum clinical effect in 50% of the population.
    * **LD~50~**\
    The dose which is lethal in 50% of the population.
* An indication of how safe a medication is at the prescribed dose
    * A **higher** TI indicates a greater margin for safety\
    A drug generally has a good safety profile if it has a **TI >10**.
    * Drugs with a narrow TI have a small range between dose for efficacy and dose for harm\

:::column-margin
**Narrow therapeutic index** drugs are also  known as "critical dose drugs" or drugs with a "narrow therapeutic range". They are defined as drugs where the TI:

* **TI** is **<2**
* Ratio of the minimum toxic concentration and minimum therapeutic concentration is <2
* Safe use requires titration and monitoring
:::

:::column-margin
A related term is the **therapeutic range**, or therapeutic window, which is the *difference* between the minimum therapeutic concentration and the minimum toxic concentration.

## Indications

Drugs that typically require monitoring have a:

* Narrow target range
* Significant pharmacokinetic variability
* Relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effects
* Determined concentration range
* Validated monitoring assay

Drugs where the effect can be measured clinically (e.g. antihypertensives) tend to be adjusted based on observed effects. This is not possible when:

* The clinical response is the *absence* of a condition, e.g. antiepileptics
* The drug has a narrow therapeutic range


: Commonly Monitored Drugs in the ICU Setting

|    Drug    | Therapeutic Range |
|------------+-------------------|
| Digoxin    | 0.8-2 microgram/L |
| Vancomycin | 10-20 mg/L*       |
| Tacrolimus | 5-20 microgram/L  |
| Serolimus  | 5-15 microgram/L  |
| Phenytoin  | 10-20 mg/L        |

## Timing of Samples

Timing depends on the reason for sampling:

::: column-margin
Timing of sampling is less important for drugs with long half-lives.
:::

* Time of **peak concentration** is mostly important for toxicity\
This requires accounting for absorption and distribution.
    * e.g. Digoxin levels should be performed >6 hours following a dose to allow time for distribution to occur
    * If symptomatic, samples taken at this time may demonstrate toxic concentrations
* **Steady state** is optimal for **monitoring**
    * i.e. after 4-5 elimination half-lives
    * For drugs with very long half-lives (such as amiodarone), sampling tends to occur earlier to ensure toxic levels have not been reached, as steady state may take months to achieve
* **Trough levels** are best for drugs with **short half-lives**\
These are pre-dose levels, and are best because they are usually the least variable point in the dosing interval.

## Interpretation

Interpretation of drug levels is dependent on:

* **Timing** of sample
* Duration of treatment at the current dose and **dosing** schedule
* Individual characteristics that may affect the **pharmacokinetics**
    * Age
    * Physiology
    * Comorbidities (hepatic, renal, cardiac)
    * Drug interactions
    * Genetics
    * Environmental
* **Protein binding**\
    * Assays measure bound and unbound drug\
    Only unbound drug is pharmacologically active.
    * If binding is changed by disease or displacement by other drug, the proportion of unbound drug may change and targeted levels may need to be adjusted accordingly
* **Active metabolites**\
Active metabolites are not measured but will contribute to the response.
