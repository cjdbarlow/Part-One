# Drug Monitoring

:::dual
Explain clinical drug monitoring with regard to peak and trough concentrations, minimum therapeutic concentration and toxicity
:::

Drug monitoring:

* Describes the individualisation of dosing by maintaining plasma drug levels within a target range
* Is important in adjusting dose to account for inter-patient variability in response\
Variability can be:\
  * Pharmacokinetic\
  Adjusting drug dose by monitoring plasma levels reduces pharmacokinetic variability.
  * Pharmacodynamic\
  Drug dose is adjusted by evaluating the clinical effect. 

Drug levels are measured to ensure the concentration is above the minimum therapeutic concentration but below toxic levels:

* **Minimum therapeutic concentration**\
The ED~50~, i.e. the dose required to have an effect in 50% of the population.
  * Determines desired **trough levels**\
* **Minimum toxic concentration**\
The LD~50~, or the dose which is lethal in 50% of the population.\
  * Determines the acceptable **peak levels**

From these levels two related terms are derived:

* Therapeutic range (also known as the therapeutic window)\
**Difference** between these levels.
* Therapeutic index\
**Ratio** between these levels, i.e.\
$Therapeutic \ Index = {LD_{50} \over ED_{50}}$
  * A higher therapeutic index gives a greater margin for safety

## Indications

Drugs are monitored in order to:

* Avoid **toxicity**
* Adjust dosing for **efficacy**\
* **Monitor** compliance or determine failure of therapy

Drugs that typically require monitoring have a:

* Narrow target range
* Significant pharmacokinetic variability
* Relationship between the concentration in plasma and clinical effects
* Determined concentration range
* Validated monitoring assay

Drugs where the effect can be measured clinically (e.g. antihypertensives) tend to be adjusted based on observed effects. This is not possible when:

* The clinical response is the *absence* of a condition, e.g. antiepileptics
* The drug has a narrow therapeutic range


### Commonly Monitored Drugs in the ICU Setting

|    Drug    | Therapeutic Range |
|------------+-------------------|
| Digoxin    | 0.8-2 microgram/L |
| Vancomycin | 10-20 mg/L*       |
| Tacrolimus | 5-20 microgram/L  |
| Serolimus  | 5-15 microgram/L  |
| Phenytoin  | 10-20 mg/L        |

## Timing of Samples

Timing depends on the reason for sampling:

::: column-margin
Timing of sampling is less important for drugs with long half-lives.
:::

* Time of **peak concentration** is mostly important for toxicity\
This requires accounting for absorption and distribution.
    * e.g. Digoxin levels should be performed >6 hours following a dose to allow time for distribution to occur
    * If symptomatic, samples taken at this time may demonstrate toxic concentrations
* **Steady state** is optimal for **monitoring**
    * i.e. after 4-5 elimination half-lives
    * For drugs with very long half-lives (such as amiodarone), sampling tends to occur earlier to ensure toxic levels have not been reached, as steady state may take months to achieve
* **Trough levels** are best for drugs with **short half-lives**\
These are pre-dose levels, and are best because they are usually the least variable point in the dosing interval.

## Interpretation

Interpretation of drug levels is dependent on:

* **Timing** of sample
* Duration of treatment at the current dose and **dosing** schedule
* Individual characteristics that may affect the **pharmacokinetics**
    * Age
    * Physiology
    * Comorbidities (hepatic, renal, cardiac)
    * Drug interactions
    * Genetics
    * Environmental
* **Protein binding**\
    * Assays measure bound and unbound drug\
    Only unbound drug is pharmacologically active.
    * If binding is changed by disease or displacement by other drug, the proportion of unbound drug may change and targeted levels may need to be adjusted accordingly
* **Active metabolites**\
Active metabolites are not measured but will contribute to the response.
