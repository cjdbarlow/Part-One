# Target-Controlled Infusions

Describe the pharmacological principles of and sources of error with target controlled infusion
:::


Target-Controlled Infusions describes the use of pharmacokinetic models (typically^[Outside of the US, where TCI models are not licensed.] combined with microprocessor-controlled infusion pumps) to achieve a target concentration of intravenous drugs in a particular body compartment^[TCI is related to, but distinct from, total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), which is the use of IV agents alone to achieve hypnosis, analgesia, and muscle relaxation.].


## Principles of TCI

**Open-loop**:

* Effects of drug are not measured (unlike with end-tidal gas monitoring), which introduces a vulnerability that can increase risk of awareness.\
e.g. Compared to inhalational anaesthetics, where the loop is closed by using end-tidal drug monitoring.


**B**olus, **E**limination, and **T**ransfer principle:

* A loading dose is given to saturate the volume of distribution to achieve target concentration\
$Loading \ Dose = V_D \times C_P$
* Infusion rate is then set to maintain a target plasma or effect site concentration:\
$Maintenance \ Infusion \ Rate \ (MIR) = Cl \times C_{P/e}$
    * Rate compensates for:
        * Drug elimination
        * Drug distribution (transfer)
* Target $C_P$ (or $C_e$) can be adjusted:
    * For a higher concentration:
        * A small bolus is given
        * Infusion rate is increased
    * For a lower concentration:
        * Infusion is paused until desired level is reached
        * Infusion rate restarts at a lower rate


### Plasma Targeting $C_P$

In plasma targeted infusions, $C_P$ will not approximate $C_e$ until steady state is reached. Therefore:

* Increase $C_P$ during induction, so that $C_e$ will rise more quickly
* $C_P$ should be adjusted to the level of the surgical stimulus

### Effect-Site Targeting

In $C_e$ models, the "over-pressure" occurs automatically, so there is no requirement to increase target during induction.

## TCI Models for Propofol

**The Bristol Model:**

* First pharmacokinetic model
* Based on three-compartment model of health patients
* Assumes:
    * Premedication with temazepam
    * Fentanyl 3μg.kg^-1^ on induction
    * Inhaled N~2~O
    * A target plasma concentration ($C_P$) of 3μg.ml^-1^
* The model:
    * 1mg.kg^-1^ induction bolus
    * 10-8-6 maintenance:
        * 10mg.kg^-1^.hr^-1^ for 10 minutes
        * 8mg.kg^-1^.hr^-1^ for 10 minutes
        * 6mg.kg^-1^.hr^-1^ thereafter

**Marsh and Schnider Models:**

* These are computer controlled models
* Both were derived on very small groups of patients (18 and 24 respectively)
* The models differ mostly in the first 10 minutes after induction, and progressively converge\
The initial behaviour of the model is key in deciding which model to apply to any particular patient.

| **Targets**            | Typically target plasma concentration, but can target effect site. <br><br>Effect site targeting is usually done with the modified Marsh model, due to the large bolus dosing given by the standard Marsh model.                                    | Typically effect site, but can target plasma concentration. <br><br>Plasma targeting gives inconsistent results, as the fixed size of V~1~ means any increase in desired plasma concentration results in the same size bolus being given, irrespective of patient parameters. |
| **Required variables** | TBW (overestimates induction (but not maintenance) in obese patients, consider using IBW), Age (but not used in calculation)                                                                                                                        | Age, height (to calculate lean body mass), TBW                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Values**             | Variable compartment sizes but bigger V~1~                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Fixed V~1~ (4.27L) and V~3~, variable V~2~ and K~eo~                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Other**              | The 'modified Marsh' model uses a k~eo~ of 1.2L.min^-1^ instead of 0.26L.min^-1^, which decreases the $C_P \ $required to achieve the target $C_e$quickly. The modified Marsh is therefore preferable in patients at higher risk of overdose. | Limits BMI to < 42 for males and < 35 for females, to prevent absurd compartment sizes being calculated from the method used to calculate lean body mass                                                                                                                      |
| **Overall**            | Faster induction due to larger V~1~, which results in a larger loading dose                                                                                                                                                                         | Reduced rate of adverse events. Overall less propofol used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
