Pharmacokinetic models are mathematical concepts used to predict plasma concentrations of drugs at different time points.



## One-Compartment Models

The simplest model imagines the body a single, well-stirred compartment. 

<img src="/resources/1compartment.svg" style="width: 10pc;">

In a one compartment model, the concentration of a drug ($C$) at time $t$ is given by the equation:

$C = C_0 e^{-kt}$

Where:

* $C_0$ is the concentration at time 0\
As drug can only be eliminated from the compartment, this is also the peak concentration.
* $k$ is the **rate constant for elimination**\
This is the fraction of the Vd from which the drug is removed per unit time. The rate constant **determines** the **slope** of the curve.
    * A **high rate constant for elimination** results in **a steep curve** and therefore **a short time constant**


### Steady State

At steady state, **input is equal to output**. Therefore concentration at steady state is:

* Proportional to the concentration of the infusion and infusion rate
* Inversely proportional to the clearance:\

$\begin{aligned}
Input &= Output \\
C_i.I &= C_{ss}.Cl \\
C_{ss} &= {C_i.I \over Cl} \\
\end{aligned}$

* **Concentration** of drug can therefore be **determined by the amount infused and** the **clearance**
* Note steady state requires peripheral compartments to be saturated, and so will only occur after an infusion of many hours

## Multiple Compartment Models

Multi-compartment models imagine the body as a series of differently-sized containers, which distribute drug between them at different rates. Multi-compartment models:

* Are used because they tend to have a better fit with experimental data than single compartment models  
Three-compartment models are the most common: additional compartments typically offer no extra fidelity but are mathematically more complex.
* Are usually conceptualised^[This doesn't mean that they *should* be conceptualised this way - they are a mathematical technique used to calculate plasma concentration at a given time.] as a:
    * Plasma (or central) compartment\
    Drug is usually given into and eliminated from the central compartment.
    * A well-perfused (or vessel-rich group) compartment
    * A poorly-perfused (or vessel-poor group) compartment

Plasma concentration in multi-compartment models is:

* Predicted through the net effect of several negative exponential equations\
* Dependent on the relative effects of:
    * **Distribution** \
    Distribution describes the movement of drug from the central compartment (V~1~) to the peripheral compartment(s).
        * Rapid fall in plasma concentration of a drug after administration is generally due to distribution\
        Distribution is an important method for drug offset in short-acting drugs.
    * **Redistribution**\
    Redistribution refers to the movement of drug from the peripheral compartment(s) back into plasma.
        * Drugs which have a large V~D~ in a peripheral compartment tend to **distribute quickly** along this concentration gradient, and **redistribute slowly** back into plasma
        * Drugs which tend to **distribute slowly** tend to **redistribute quickly** once administration has ceased
    * **Excretion**\
    Excretion is the removal of drug from the body. 

### Clearance in Multi-Compartment Models

:::info
This will use two-compartment models as an example of clearance in multi-compartment models. The principles are the same for more complex models.
:::

Removal of drug in two-compartment models is via:

* Distribution from the central to the peripheral compartment
* Elimination from the central compartment
* This produces a **bi-exponential** fall in plasma concentration\
Consists of two phases:
    * Phase α\
    Distribution phase: A rapid decline in plasma concentration due to distribution to peripheral tissues.
    * Phase β\
    Elimination phase: Slow decline in plasma concentration due to:
        * Elimination from the body
        * Redistribution into plasma

^[Note that the distribution and elimination curves appear straight because the y-axis is log-transformed.\
\
If plasma concentration was plotted on the y-axis, then each of these curves would be a negative exponential (wash-out curve).]<img src="/resources/biexponent.svg">


This curve is given by the equation $C = Ae^{-\alpha t} + Be^{-\beta t}$, where:

* $C$ is the concentration of drug in plasma
* $A$ is the y-intercept of the distribution exponent\
Used to calculate distribution half-life.
* $B$ is the y-intercept of the elimination exponent\
Used to calculate elimination half-life.
* $\alpha$ is the rate constant for distribution\
The value of $\alpha$ is dependent on the ratio of rate constants for distribution and redistribution (i.e. $k_{12} \over k_{21}$).
    * If distribution greatly exceeds redistribution, the gradient of $\alpha$ will be very steep and plasma concentration will fall rapidly after administration
* $\beta$ is the rate constant for elimination\


### The Effect Site

Pharmacokinetic models typically display the plasma concentration. Clinically however, we are interested in **drug concentrations** at the **site of action** (e.g. the brain); this is **known as** the **effect site** or **biophase**. Effect site concentration:

* This cannot be measured, and so is a calculated value
* Is given by $Ce$
* Will differ from plasma concentration ($Cp$) prior to reaching steady state\
This delay between plasma and effect site concentrations is an example of **hysteresis**.
* Can be modeled as an additional compartment in three-compartment models\
The effect site is modeled as a **compartment of negligible volume** contained **within V~1~**, but with its own rate constants. Therefore:
    * Effect site volume changes as V~1~ changes
    * The k~1e~ is the rate constant for drug diffusion from plasma into the effect site
    * The **k~e0~** is the rate constant for elimination of drug **from the effect site**\
    This is a theoretical elimination pathway - drug is not usually metabolised at the effect site.
    * The **t~1/2~ke0 is the effect-site equilibration time**^[Note neither the t~1/2~ke0 or the k~e0~ are the time to peak effect.]\
    It **describes how rapidly the effect site reaches equilibrium with plasma**.
        * A **high ke0** (rapid drug flow) equals a **short t~1/2~ke0**
        * After one t~1/2~ke0, 50% of the final effect site concentration will be reached provided plasma concentration remains constant
        **A shorter t~1/2~ke0 indicates that that the effect site concentration will reach equilibrium with plasma more rapidly, and therefore a more rapid clinical effect following administration is seen**.\
            * For an infusion run at constant plasma concentration the peak effect will be seen at 3-5x the t~1/2~ke0
            * The time to peak effect is a function of both plasma kinetics and the t~1/2~ke0\
            e.g. Adenosine has such a short elimination t~1/2~ the effect site concentration will reach its peak rapidly regardless of the k~e0~.

## Non-Compartmental Models

Compartment models are not appropriate for describing the behaviours of all drugs. Non-compartmental models are used when drug:

* Clearance is organ-independent
* Elimination does not occur solely from the central compartment

These models use **AUC**, which is calculated by measuring the plasma concentration of a drug at different time intervals, and **plotting the area under the curve (AUC)**. This can be used to:

* Determine **clearance**\
$Cl = {Dose \over AUC}$
* Determine **Bioavailability**\
Difference between the AUC of the same dose of drug administered IV and via another route.
