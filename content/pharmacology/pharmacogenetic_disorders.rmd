# Pharmacogenetic Disorders

:::CICM
Explain the mechanisms and significance of pharmacogenetic disorders (eg malignant hyperpyrexia, porphyria, atypical cholinesterase and disturbance of cytochrome function)
:::

Key (examinable) disorders include:

* Pseudocholinesterase deficiency
* G6PD
* Malignant Hyperthermia
* Porphyrias

## Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency

A condition where plasma cholinesterase is unable to breakdown suxamethonium, prolonging its duration of action. This disease:

* May be congenital or acquired
  * Congenital is autosomal recessive\
  Has four alleles
    * Usual
    * Atypical (dibucaine-resistant)
    * Silent (absent)
    * Fluoride-resistance
  * Acquired is due to a loss of plasma cholinesterase
    * Pregnancy
    * Organ failure
      * Hepatic
      * Renal
      * Cardiac
    * Malnutrition
    * Hyperthyroidism
    * Burns
    * Malignancy
    * Drugs
      * OCP
      * Ketamine
      * Lignocaine and ester local anaesthetics
      * Metoclopramide
      * Lithium
* Has been traditionally measured using the **dibucaine number**\
Dibucaine is:
  * An amide local anaesthetic which **inhibits plasma cholinesterase**\
  Different forms are inhibited to different extents, with greater inhibition indicating a less severe mutation.
    * Percentage inhibition correlates with different genotypes, e.g.:
      * Normal (Eu:Eu) has a dibucaine number of 80 (80% inhibited)
      * Dibucaine resistant (Ea:Ea) has a dibucaine number of 20 (20% inhibited)
    * Note that acquired disease will have a normal dibucaine number, as the enzyme itself is working correctly, however does not exist in a large enough quantity to metabolise suxamethonium rapidly 

## G6PD

A common x-linked recessive condition that may cause haemolysis following administration of oxidative drugs. These include:

* Aspirin
* Sulfonamides
* Some antibiotics

## Malignant Hyperthermia

Autosomal dominant deficiency in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene resulting in a defect of intracellular calcium regulation. This mutation:

* Causes massive calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in the presence of volatile anaesthetic agents (and potentially suxamethonium)\
Leads to:
  * Increased muscle activity
  * Rapid increase in body temperature and lactic acidosis
  * High mortality from hyperthermia, hyperkalaemia/rhabdomyolysis, leading to ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest
* Mutation present in 1:5,000 - 1:50,000
* Presents with:
  * Initially:
    * Tachycardia
    * Masseter spasm
    * Hypercapnea
    * Arrhythmia
  * Intermediate:
    * Hyperthermia
    * Sweating
    * Combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Muscle rigidity
  * Late:
    * Rhabdomyolysis
      * Myoglobinuria
      * Elevated CK
    * Coagulopathy
    * Cardiac arrest
* Management consists of:
  * Cease administration of volatile
    * Start TIVA
  * Give **dantrolene**
    * 2.5mg.kg^-1^ increments up to 10mg.kg^-1^
    * 20mg vials reconstituted with 60ml sterile water
      * 3g mannitol as additive
      * Highly alkaline\
      Damaging if extravasation occurs.
  * Treat complications:
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Hyperthermia
    * Acidosis
    * Arrhythmias
    * Renal failure

## Porphyria

Autosomal dominant deficiency in the first step of haeme synthesis. These mutations:

* Result in a partial deficiency of enzymes
* Lead to accumulation of porphyrin precursors
* May be precipitated by many drugs:
  * Ketamine
  * Clonidine
  * Ketorolac
  * Diclofenac
  * Phenytoin
  * Erythromycin
  * Barbiturates
