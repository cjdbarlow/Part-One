# The Viva

The viva is the part of the exam most candidates seem most stressed about. However:

* If you make it through the written, you will most likely pass\
Very few people succeed in the written exams to fail at the viva.
    * The knowledge is there
    * Examiners want you to pass\
    They will redirect you if you're off track.
        * This makes it easier to make up marks than on the written, where you can easily go off down the rabbit hole, haemorrhaging time and marks


## Understanding the Viva

To do well at the viva:

* Understand **the viva is a performance piece**\
The viva is a ritualised conversation. Success requires you to know and understand the language and structure used, just like the SAQ.
* **Structure your answer**\
As with the SAQ, categorise your answer.
    * Have a good opening statement\
    Don't answer more than is asked.
    * Start broad\
    Often the viva will go into depth on only one or two areas of a topic. If you start going into detail on only parts of a topic, it makes it hard for the examiner to redirect you and scores you no marks.
* Be confident\
Enjoy it if you can.
* Learn to think on your feet\
The viva assesses knowledge in a different way to the SAQs.
    * The knowledge will be there, but it may require a different approach to access it\
    This requires **practice**.
    * This is also important for delivering a sound answer based on incomplete knowledge
* It's okay to say "I don't know"\
But probably not on the first question.
    * If you don't know immediately, can you work it out from first principles?\
* Don't get angry\
    * With yourself
    * With the examiner\
    Don't argue.
* Don't apologise\
Apologies:
    * Make you lose confidence
    * Don't get you marks\
    Remember, marks per unit-time.
* Don't talk over the examiner\
They are interrupting you because what you are saying is gaining no marks. If you keep talking, you will:
    * Not be getting marks
    * Irritate them\
    Potentially losing future marks.
