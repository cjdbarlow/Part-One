# Iron Homeostasis

>	Describe the normal nutritional requirements

Approximately 3-5g of iron is found in the body as:

* **Oxygen-carrying globin molecules**\
Haemoglobin (~70%) and myoglobin (~5%).
* **Catalyst** for biological reactions (~25%)\
Catalase, peroxidase, and cytochromes all require iron.

## Absorption

Dietary iron comes in two forms:

* Haeme groups\
Directly absorbed via specialised transport proteins.
* Dietary iron salts\
  * Ferrous (Fe^2+^) iron is soluble, and is absorbed via facilitated diffusion across the enterocyte membrane
    * Reduced acidity of the stomach will reduce the absorption of ferrous iron
  * Ferric (Fe^3+^) iron precipitates when pH > 3, and so cannot be absorbed independently by the small bowel.
    * A pathway may exist for absorption of ferric iron from soluble chelates


* Once in the enterocyte, iron can be:
  * Stored, bound to **ferritin**
  * Transported via **ferroportin** out of the enterocyte, where it is then oxidised to ferrous iron and bound to **transferrin**

## Regulation

* Excretion is uncontrolled
* Regulation of iron levels is only by absorption
* **Hepcidin** is a liver protein which inhibits the action of ferroportin
  * High hepcidin prevents iron transport from the enterocyte
  * Hepcidin is deficient in haemochromatosis
