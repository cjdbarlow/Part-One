>Understanding the adverse consequences of blood transfusion, including that of  massive blood transfusion

## Production and Storage of Blood Products

Red cells, platelets, and FFP have different storage requirements.

### Red Blood Cells

* Stored blood decays over time - this is known as a **storage lesion**\
Preservatives are used to extend the time blood can be stored:
    *  Kept at ~4°C (balance between freezing and being too warm)
        * Reduces cellular metabolic requirement
        * Inhibits bacterial growth
    * Collected in an aseptic fashion
    * Stored in special solutions:
      * SAGM is currently used by the Australian Red Cross:
          * Saline
          * Adenine\
          Substrate for ATP synthesis
          * Glucose\
          Substrate for RBC glycolysis
          * Mannitol
      * CPDA1 (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine) was traditionally used
          * Citrate binds calcium, preventing clotting
          * Phosphate acts as a buffer and phosphate source for metabolism
          * Dextrose 
          * Adenine 


* A **storage lesion** describes the changes that occur in stored blood:
    * Loss of 2,3 DPG\
    Less of a factor in CPDA1 blood.
    * Haemolysis
    * Hyperkalaemia\
    Typically not clinically relevant as potassium is taken up into red cells when metabolism resumes.
    * Acidaemia
    * Hyponatraemia\
    Not clinically significant.


* Blood can be stored for up to 35 days, which corresponds to 70% survival

### Platelets

Platelets require particular storage conditions to remain functional:

* Temperature ~22°C\
Below this, platelets deform and become non-functional
* Gas exchange\
Platelets are stored in a bag which allows gas exchange to occur, minimising lactic acid and carbon dioxide production
* Agitation\
Platelets are stored on an agitator which prevents clotting and ensures the platelets are well mixed, which maximises the diffusion gradient for gas exchange
* pH control\
pH is kept between 6.2 to 7.8 to prevent degranulation.

As platelets do not contain antigen, there is not a *strict* requirement for platelets to be type matched. However:

* Rh(+) platelets should be avoided in Rh(-) patients\
The small amount of contaminating red cells may precipitate rhesus disease.
* Plasma incompatibility should be avoided as this may lead to haemolysis of recipient red cells
    * Children are at greater risk due to their proportionally smaller blood volume

### Fresh Frozen Plasma

Fresh Frozen Plasma is:

* Prepared either via:
    * Separation from whole blood
    * Apheresis\
    Removal of a large volume (typically 800ml) of plasma from a single patient, with return of red cells to the donor.
* Once collected, it is frozen and re-thawed in a water bath prior to use

### Cryoprecipitate

Cryoprecipitate is prepared by removing the precipitate from FFP which forms at 1–6°C. Cryoprecipitate contains predominantly:

* Fibrinogen
* Fibronectin
* vWF
* Factor VIII
* Factor XIII
  \

### Whole Blood

Whole blood undergoes additional changes:

* White cells become nonfunctional within 4-6 hours of collection, though antigenic properties remain
* Platelets become non-functional within 48 hours of storage at 4°C
* Factor levels decrease significantly after 21 days


## Blood Groups

Blood groups refer to the expression of surface antigens by red blood cells, as well as any antibody in plasma. Blood groups can be divided into three types:

* ABO
* Rhesus
* Other antibodies
These are additional antibodies that a patient may express in plasma, and include Kell, Lewis, Duffy, etc.

### ABO

The ABO blood group is:

* A complex carbohydrate-based antigens series\
These may be either A or B antigen, and patients may express one, both, or neither, giving four blood groups (A, B, AB, O).
* Expressed on the **H-antigen stem** of RBCs, and on the surface of tissue cells.
    * The **Bombay Blood Group** (or **hh** or **Oh** group) describes individuals who do not express the H antigen\
    These individuals:
        * Don't express A- or B-antigen (as there is no H-antigen stem) and are 'universal donors'
        * Express H-antibody\
        Can only receive blood from other individuals with the Bombay phenotype
* Individuals express IgM antibody to foreign blood groups\
    This develops within 6 months of birth, likely due to environmental exposure to similar antigens.
* Associated with a severe hypersensitivity reaction if an ABO-mismatch occurs

|Group|RBC|Plasma|
|--|--|
|A|A-antigen|B-antibody|
|B|B-antigen|A-antibody|
|O|-|A-antibody <br> B-antibody
|AB|A-antigen <br> B-antigen|-|

### Rhesus

The Rhesus blood group is the next most important group after ABO. The Rhesus system:

* Consists of ~50 different antigens, the most important of which is **D**\
Rhesus status is therefore expressed as positive (D - 85% of the population) or negative (anything-but-D).
* Rhesus antibody does not naturally occur in Rh(-) individuals\
    * This is relevant in Rhesus disease\
    A Rh(-) mother exposed to Rh(+) blood will develop Anti-D antibody, which can cross placenta and induce abortion in a future Rh(+) foetus. This can occur with:
        * Incompatible transfusion
        * Foetal-maternal haemorrhage\

## Compatibility Testing


Donor blood must be tested with recipient blood to avoid a transfusion reaction. This involves three steps:

* **Blood Typing** (ABO/Rh)\
  * Patient's blood is mixed with samples of plasma known to contain Anti-A, Anti-B, or Anti-AB antibodies.
  * Agglutination occurs when antibodies in the plasma react with the antigen on the RBC surface, and indicates a mismatch
* **Antibody Screen**\
For minor (non-ABO/Rh) group antibodies.
  * Testing is similar to ABO screening, but now patient *plasma* is mixed with several samples of red cells which contain a known non-ABO/Rh antigen (e.g. Kell, Duffy), and monitored for agglutination
* **Cross-match**\
Two methods:
  * Electronic cross-match\
  Used if the antibody screen is negative and the patient has had no previous blood transfusion, as it is quicker and cheaper.
  * Serological cross match\
  Indicated if the antibody screen is positive, or the patient has had previous exposure to blood (prior transfusion, pregnancy), as this gives the patient a risk of exposure to non-ABO or Rh antigens.
    * Performed by mixing patient plasma with a small sample of donor RBC and monitoring for agglutination
      If there is no agglutination, the transfusion can proceed with the tested specimen **only**.


### Indirect Coomb's Test

Method of cross-matching that is now deprecated as it provides negligible additional safety over the above processes. Testing identifies IgG antibody in host *plasma* which would haemolyse transfused red cells, and involves:

* Incubating\
  Binds IgG Ab to antigen on RBC membrane.
* Washing\
  Removes serum and unbound IgG.
* Testing with an antibody *to* IgG, known as antiglobulin serum.
  * A positive test will cause clumping of red cells, as each antiglobulin serum will bind two IgG molecules, which have in turn been bound to red cells
  * A negative test will cause no agglutination, as the IgG has not been bound to red cells
  * If negative, the antiglobulin serum is re-used on a control sample to ensure that it is not a false negative


## Transfusion Reactions

An adverse event associated with the transfusion of whole blood or one of its components. Can be classified as either acute (< 24 hours) or delayed (> 24 hours), and as immunological or non-immunological.

### Immunological Acute Reactions


|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|ABO Mismatch|1:40,000|ABO incompatibility causing rapid intravascular haemolysis, which may cause chest pain, jaundice, shock, and DIC. RhD-reactions tend to cause extravascular haemolysis.
|Haemolytic (acute)|1:76,000 (1:1.8 million fatal)|Immunological destruction of transfused cells (Type II hypersensitivity). Presents with fever, tachycardia, pain, progressing to distributive shock|
|Febrile, non-haemolytic|~1:100|Cytokine release from stored cells causing a mild inflammatory reaction, with temperature rising to ≥38ºC or ≥1ºC above baseline (if >37ºC). Benign - but requires exclusion of a haemolytic reaction.
|Urticaria|1:100|Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins in the transfused unit
|Anaphylaxis|1:20,000|Type I hypersensitivity reaction to plasma protein in transfused unit
|TRALI|Variable|Donor plasma HLA activates recipient pulmonary neutrophils, causing fever, shock, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema

### Non-Immunological Acute Reactions

|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Massive Transfusion Complications|Variable|See below
|Non-immune mediated haemolysis|Rare|Due to physicochemical damage to RBCs (freezing, device malfunction). May lead to haemoglobinuria, haemoglobinaemia, tachycardia and fevers.
|Sepsis|1:75,000 (platelets), 1:500,000 (RBC)|Contamination during collection or processing. Most common organisms are those which use iron as a nutrient and reproduce at low temperatures, e.g. *Yersinia Pestis*.
|Transfusion Related Circulatory Overload (TACO)|< 1:100|Rapid increase in intravascular volume in patients with poor circulatory compliance or chronic anaemia. May result in pulmonary oedema and be confused with TRALI.

### Delayed Immunological Reaction

|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction|1:2,500|Development of sensitisation with the reaction occurring 2-14 days after a single exposure. Typically Kidd, Duffy, Kell antibodies.
|Post-transfusion Purpura|Rare|Alloimmunisation to Human Platelet Antigen causing sudden self-limiting thrombocytopenia
|TA-GVHD|Rare|Transfused lymphocytes recognise host HLA as positive causing marrow aplasia, with mortality >90%
|Alloimmunisation| 1:100 (RBC antigens), 1:10 (HLA antigens)|Previous sensitisation leading to  antibody production on re-exposure.
|Transfusion-related Immune Modulation|Not known|Transient immunosuppression following transfusion potentially due to cytokine release from leukocytes

### Delayed Non-Immunological Reaction

|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Iron Overload|Chelation after 10-20 units, organ dysfunction 50-100 units|Each unit of PRBC contains ~250mg of iron, whilst average excretion is 1mg.day^-1^.


## Complications of Massive Transfusion

A **massive transfusion** is one where:

* Greater than **one-half** of **circulating volume** in **4 hours**
* Whole **circulating volume** in **24 hours**


Risk of complication from a massive transfusion is influenced by:

* Number of units
* Rate of transfusion
* Patient factors

|Complication|Mechanism|
|------|-----------|
|Air embolism|Inadvertent infusion
|Hypothermia|Cooled products
|Hypocalcaemia|Consumption with coagulopathy and bound to citrate added to transfused units
|Hypomagnesaemia|Bound to citrate in transfused units
|Citrate toxicity|Citrate is added to stored units as an anticoagulant
|Lactic acidosis|Hyperlactataemia due to anaerobic metabolism in stored units
|Hyperkalaemia|Potassium migrates from stored erythrocytes into plasma whilst in storage
