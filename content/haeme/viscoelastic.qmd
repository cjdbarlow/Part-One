Viscoelastic coagulation testing, also known as point-of-care coagulation testing provides information on all phases of clotting, and:

* Involves testing of **whole blood**\
Traditional testing uses plasma only.
* Includes the **cell-based model** of coagulation\
* *May* **better represent actual clotting function** compared with traditional coagulation factor testing.
* Includes:
	* Thromboelastography
	* Rotational thromboelastometry

## Thromboelastography

Continuous measurement and display of viscoelastic properties of a blood sample from initial fibrin formation to clot retraction, and ultimately fibrinolysis. TEG involves:

* A known volume (typically 0.36ml) of whole blood added to activators in two disposable cuvettes (cups) heated to 37°C\
	* Contact activators (such as kaolin) are added to the blood to accelerate clotting
	* A heparinase cuvette is also commonly used so clotting function can be measured during full anticoagulation (e.g. CPB)
* Pin attached to torsion wire immersed into blood
Torsion on the pin is converted (by a transducer) into a TEG tracing.
* Cuvette rotates through 4°45′ in alternate directions\
Each rotation takes 10s.
* Pin initially remains stationary as it rotates through the un-clotted blood\
This is represented by a straight line on the tracing.
* **As blood clots, cup rotation exerts torque on the pin**
* The stronger the blood clot, the greater the torque exerted on the pin


## Rotational Thromboelastometry

ROTEM is a modified version of TEG:

* A pin fixed to a steel axis is rotated in blood via movement of a spring\
The cuvette remains stationary.
* Two samples are used:
	* Tissue factor is added to measure the extrinsic pathway (known as the ENTEM cuvette)
	* Contact activator is added to measure the intrinsic pathway (INTEM cuvette)
* Impedance to rotation is detected by an optical system:
	* LED
	* Mirror on the steel axis
	* Electronic camera
* **Uses different reference ranges and nomenclature to TEG**


### Interpretation

:::column-margin
Note that reference ranges are not included, as these vary depending on the:

* Technique (TEG/ROTEM) used
* Activator used
* Adjuvants added\
e.g. Citrated vs. recalcified samples.
