# Haemostasis

> Describe the process and regulation of haemostasis, coagulation ~~and fibrinolysis~~

Haemostasis describes the physiological processes that occur to stop bleeding. It involves three processes:

* **Vessel constriction**\
  Decreases flow, which limits further haemorrhage and reduces the shear stresses which break up forming clot
* **Platelet plug formation** or Primary Haemostasis\
    Platelets adhere to the damaged vessel wall and aggregate
* **Fibrin formation** or Secondary Haemostasis\
    Fibrin is formed from fibrinogen (via the coagulation cascade), which stabilises the platelet plug


## Primary Haemostasis

Following a vascular injury, the exposure of subendothelial proteins stimulates platelets to form an occlusive plug via several processes:

* **Adhesion**\
    Exposed collagen binds to GPIa receptor on platelets.\
    vWF also binds to platelets.


* **Activation**\
  Metabolic activation, increasing Phospholipase A~2~ and Phospholipase C, increasing platelet intracellular Ca^2+^ and initiating a transformation from a disc to a sphere with long projections.
    * Metabolic activation is stimulated by:
        * Collagen
        * Adrenaline
        * ADP
        * Thrombin 
    * Additionally, platelets release ADP and thromboxane A~2~ from their **alpha granules** and **dense bodies**, amplifying further platelet aggregation and adhesion
  \
  \
* **Aggregation**\
With other platelets - held together by fibrin - forming a plug.

* **Contraction**\
  After some time platelets contract, retracting the clot and sealing the wall.

## Secondary Haemostasis{#sec}

The coagulation cascade is an amplification mechanism which activates clotting factors in order to produce fibrin.

Participating factors in the coagulation cascade can be either **enzymes** or **cofactors**:

* Enzymes circulate in their inactive form, and become active (e.g. VII â‡’ VIIa) when hydrolysed by their precursor factor
* Cofactors amplify the cascade

### Pathways

The cascade is divided into the **intrinsic pathway** and **extrinsic pathway**, which join to form the **common pathway**. *In vitro*, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways operate separately. This is an artifact of lab measurement - *in vivo* **the pathways are co-dependent**.

#### Extrinsic Pathway

The extrinsic pathway contains two factors, and the process of activation **occurs in seconds**:

* Tissue Factor\
Membrane protein on sub-endothelial cells, which is exposed when the vessel is damaged (it is found in a few other places as well). It binds to factor VII to form VIIa, and thus activates the extrinsic pathway.
* Factor VII

#### Intrinsic Pathway

The intrinsic pathway is activated **over minutes**, and contains:

* Contact factors\
Only important *in vitro* when conducting lab testing - deficiency of these factors does not cause a coagulopathy.
  * HMWK\
  HMWK activates factor XII.
  * Factor XII\
  Factor XIIa activates factor IX, as does thrombin.
* Factor XI
* Factor IX
* Factor VIII\
Factor VIII circulates in a complex with vWF, preventing it from degradation. When activated by thrombin, it acts as a cofactor for factor IXa to activate factor X.

The intrinsic pathway is activated by:

* Thrombin\
Main activator of the intrinsic pathway *in vivo*.
* Collagen
* Glass\
In vitro.

#### Common Pathway

The common pathway contains:

* Factor X
* Factor V\
Cofactor (similar to factor VIII), which when activated by thrombin allows factor Xa to convert prothrombin into thrombin.
* Factor II (prothrombin)\
Has several key roles:
  * Cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin
  * Activates factor XIII\
  Factor XIIIa stabilises clot by forming cross-bridges between fibrin in a platelet plug.
  * Amplification of the clotting cascade by activating factors V and VIII
  * Activates protein C\
  Thrombin binds with thrombomodulin to form a complex which inhibits coagulation.
* Factor I (fibrinogen)


## The Cell-Based Model of Coagulation

* The cascade model (above) accurately describes the process of clotting *in vitro*, but not *in vivo*
* The cell-based model has several changes, noting the central role of the platelet:
  * **Initiation phase**\
  Coagulation begins with tissue factor being exposed, which also activates platelets.
  * **Amplification phase**\
  A positive feedback loop occurs:
    * Production of Xa causes production of thrombin (IIa), **priming** the system
    * Thrombin then activates factors V, VIII, and IX, accelerating Xa production and further thrombin generation
  * **Propagation phase**\
  Platelets bind activated clotting factors, causing high rates of thrombin formation around them.
