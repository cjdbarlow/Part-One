Haemostasis must be controlled to prevent rampant clotting of the vascular tree. This involves both:

* Endothelial factors
* Proteins


## Endothelial Regulation

Intact endothelium and the glycocalyx prevent clotting in a number of ways:

* **Minimise stasis**
    * High blood flow\
    Especially where flow is turbulent (large arteries).
    * Maximise laminar flow\
    Glycocalyx smooths flow.
* **Inhibition of platelet adhesion and activation**\
NO, prostacyclin, and ectonucleotidases  (which degrade ADP) inhibit platelet activation.
* **Membrane-bound anticoagulant proteins**\
    * **Hepar*an*** (not hepar*in*)\
    Activates antithrombin III.
    * **Thrombomodulin**\
    Binds thrombin, preventing cleavage of fibrinogen to fibrin. The thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates protein C (which in turn inactivates factors Va and VIIIa).
* **Prevent exposure of procoagulant protein**\
    * Collagen
    * vWF
    * Tissue Factor
* **tPA secretion** (see 'Clot Lysis')


## Clot Regulation

* Effect of blood flow
    * Dilutes clotting factors\
    Activated clotting factors are washed away and metabolised by the RES.
    * Laminar flow\
    Causes **axial streaming** of platelets, minimising endothelial contact and chance of activation.fa
* Activation of anticoagulant factors
    * **Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor**\
    Inhibits VIIa, antagonising the action of tissue factor
    * **Antithrombin III**\
    Inhibits the **serine proteases**, i.e. the non-cofactor factors in all three pathways - IIa, VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa.  \
    * **Protein C**\
    Inactivates protein Va and VIIIa, and is activated by thrombin.
    * **Protein S**\
    Cofactor which helps protein C.


## Clot Lysis

Clot breakdown is performed by:

* Tissue Plasminogen Activator (**tPA**)\
Binds to fibrin, and then cleaves plasminogen to plasmin. This keeps the plasmin formation in the vicinity of the clot, limiting its systemic spread of.
* **Plasmin** cleaves fibrin into **fibrin degradation products**\
FDPs conveniently inhibit further thrombin and fibrin formation.
