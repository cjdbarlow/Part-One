>Describe the process and regulation of haemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis

Platelets are small cell fragments which are vital in haemostasis via forming a **platelet plug**. They:

* Have a lifespan of **7-10 days**
* Are removed by the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen and liver

## Production

Platelets are:

* Anuclear circulating cell bodies, which bud from megakaryocytes\
As the megakaryocyte cell volume increases, the cell membrane invaginates and small platelets bud off.
  * The time from stem cell to platelet is **~10 days**, and is stimulated by **thrombopoietin**
* New platelets are held in the spleen for 36 hours until they mature

## Contents

* **α-granules**\
  Contain fibronectin, fibrinogen, vWF, PDGF, and Thrombospondin, platelet factor 4.
* **δ-granules**\
    Contain 5-HT, ATP, ADP, and Ca^2+^.
* **Contractile proteins**\
    Facilitate platelet deformation when activated.

## Activation

* Platelets are activated by:
  * Collagen\
  Exposed by damaged endothelium.
  * Adrenaline
  * ADP
  * Thrombin
* Activation results in several events:
  * Exocytosis of granules
  * Activation of membrane **phospholipase A~2~** to form **thromboxane A~2~**
  * Deformation from a disc to a sphere with long projections
  * Promotion of the coagulation cascade
  * Change in glycoprotein (GP) expression by the action of ADP:\
  ADP antagonists (e.g. clopidogrel) prevent expression of the GPIIb/IIIa complex.
    * GP Ib/IIb/IIIa facilitate platelet attachment to vWF\
    vWF also binds to sub-endothelial connective tissue.
    * GP IIb/IIIa are also receptors for fibrinogen, which encourages platelet aggregation
