:::

Carbon dioxide is:

* Produced in the mitochondria during the citric-acid cycle as a product of aerobic metabolism
* Eliminated (and, at steady state, produced) at a rate of **200ml.min^-1^**

Additionally, a large amount (**~120L**) is stored throughout the body, with 1.6L.kg^-1^-1.8L.kg^-1^ in relatively inaccessible compartments.

## Carbon Dioxide in Blood

In blood, CO~2~ is stored as:

* Bicarbonate (90%)
* Dissolved gas
* Carbamino compounds

|         Form        | Arterial Blood | Additional CO~2~ in venous blood |
|---------------------+----------------+----------------------------------|
| Bicarbonate         | 90%            | 60%                              |
| Dissolved           | 5%             | 10%                              |
| Carbamino compounds | 5%             | 30%                              |

### Bicarbonate

* CO~2~ diffuses freely into erythrocytes, where it can be catalysed by carbonic anhydrase to produce bicarbonate:\
$CO_2 + H_2O \Leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \Leftrightarrow H^+ + HCO_3^-$
* To maintain bicarbonate production, the products (H^+^ and HCO~3~^-^) are then removed:
  * **H^+^** ions are **buffered** to **haemoglobin**\
  $HbO_2 + H^+ \Leftrightarrow HHb + O_2$
  * Intracellular **HCO~3~^-^** is then exchanged with extracellular **Cl-** via the BAND3 membrane protein
    * This is called the Hamburger, or **Chloride Shift**
    * Chloride entering the cell draws water in along its osmotic gradient, **increasing the haematocrit of venous blood** relative to arterial blood

### Dissolved Gas

* As per **Henry's Law**, the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in blood is proportional to the PaCO~2~
* As carbon dioxide is 20x as soluble as oxygen in water, dissolved carbon dioxide contributes much greater proportion of carbon dioxide *content* than dissolved oxygen does to oxygen content

### Carbamino Compounds

* CO~2~ can bind directly to proteins (predominantly haemoglobin), which displaces a H^+^ ion:\
$Hb + CO_2 \Leftrightarrow HbCOO^- + H^+$
  * The H^+^ ion is then buffered by another plasma protein (also predominantly haemoglobin)\
    $Hb + H^+ \Leftrightarrow HHb$
* Bound CO~2~ does not contribute to the partial pressure gradient
* Carbamino compounds are only a small contributor to overall CO~2~ carriage, but contribute about one third of the arterio-venous CO~2~ difference due to the **Haldane effect**\
The Haldane effect states that deoxyHb binds CO~2~ more effectively than oxyHb. This is because:
  * DeoxyHb is a **better buffer** of **H^+^**\
  pKa of deoxyHb is 8.2, compared to that of oxyHb which is 6.6.
    * Enhanced buffering contributes ~30% of the Haldane effect
  * DeoxyHb forms carbamino compounds more easily
  Deoxy-Hb has 3.5x the affinity for CO~2~ than Oxy-Hb.
    * This forms ~70% of the Haldane effect


### CO~2~ Dissociation Curve{#curve}

This curve plots PCO~2~ against blood CO~2~ content in ml.100ml^-1^.

<img src="resources/co2-dissociation-curve.svg">

Key points:

* Mixed venous CO~2~ content is 52ml.100ml^-1^, at a PCO~2~ of 46mmHg
* Arterial CO~2~ content is 48ml.100ml^-1^, at a PCO~2~ of 40mmHg
* Approximately 50% of the arterial-mixed venous difference occurs due to the upwards shift of the curve, which is due to the Haldane effect\
This is the mechanism for changes in PO~2~ affecting the CO~2~ dissociation curve.

## Removal of CO~2~ {#tr}

CO~2~ dissolves from pulmonary arterial blood into the alveolus down a concentration gradient. As inspired CO~2~ is negligible, PACO~2~ is a function of alveolar ventilation and CO~2~ output, given by the equation:

$PACO_2 = {CO_2 \ output \over \dot{V}_A}$

Simplified, PaCO~2~ is inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation:

$PACO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$

## Distribution of Carbon Dioxide{#vent}

CO~2~ in the body can be considered as a three-compartment model:

* Well-perfused (blood, brain, kidneys)
* Moderately-perfused (resting muscle)
* Poorly-perfused (bone, fat))

* Each of these tissues has a different time-constant, such that a mismatch of ventilation with metabolic activity may take **20-30 minutes** to equilibrate across compartments
* Therefore hypoventilation and hyperventilation have different effects on PCO~2~:
    * **Hyperventilation** causes a rapid decrease in PCO~2~ in blood, subsequent (slower) redistribution from peripheral compartments
    * **Hypoventilation** causes a rise in PaCO~2~, the rate of which is determined both by production and distribution into plasma
      * With **no ventilation**, PCO~2~ rises at **3-6mmHg.min^-1^**
        * Due to the Haldane effect the PaCO~2~ will rapidly increase during passage through the pulmonary capillary (despite the fact that carbon dioxide *content* is unchanged) as the proportion of OxyHb increases
      * Therefore:
        * PaO~2~ is more sensitive at detecting early hypoventilation provided PAO~2~ is normal
        * Steady-state PCO~2~ gives the best indication of adequacy of ventilation
          * In acute hypoventilation, produced CO~2~ is preferentially stored in tissues, decreasing CO~2~ elimination
          * In acute hyperventilation, CO~2~ is mobilised from tissues resulting in increased CO~2~ elimination

### CO~2~ Cascade

|     Region    | Value (mmHg) |
|---------------+--------------|
| Mixed Venous  |           46 |
| Alveolar      |           40 |
| (Arterial)    |           40 |
| Mixed-expired |           27 |

* Venous CO~2~ diffuses into the alveolus, reaching equilibrium with arterial PCO~2~
* Alveolar CO~2~ is then diluted by dead space gas, resulting in a lower ME'CO~2~
