# Neonates and Children

## Transition at Birth

Transition from placental gas exchange to pulmonary gas exchange occurs within 20s after birth:

* Compression of the thorax through the vaginal canal expels foetal lung water
* Elastic recoil, combined with cooling of the skin and mechanical stimulation (which stimulate the respiratory centre), facilitate first breath

* The rapid drop in pulmonary vascular resistance with spontaneous breathing drives the changes in the cardiac circulation

* The **first three breaths** establish functional residual capacity\
Large changes in intrathoracic pressure in the first three breaths pressure drive alveolar amniotic fluid into the circulation, and establish FRC.

## Neonates and Children

* **Compliance**\
Neonatal chest walls are highly compliant relative to their lungs (due to both a reduced lung compliance and increased chest wall compliance), as compared to adults where lung and chest compliance is equal. Therefore elastic work of breathing is largely determined by the lungs.
* **Oxygenation**
    * O~2~ consumption is ~10ml.kg^-1^.min^-1^ in neonates, and 6ml.kg^-1^.min^-1^ in children
    * There is a ~10% shunt after birth which contributes to a greater A-a gradient
* **Ventilation**
    * Obligate nose breathers
    * Increased CO~2~ production due to higher metabolic rate
    * Increased minute ventilation, which is due to increased respiratory rate (25-40 breaths per minute)
* **Neurological control of breathing**\
Respiratory patterns change following birth, and complete change to adult respiratory patterns may take some weeks. Patterns include:
    * **Periodic breathing** is a slowly oscillating respiratory rate and V~T~
    * **Periodic apnoea** is intermittent apnoea interspersed with normal breathing.
* **Volumes and capacities**
    * Closing capacity is increased relative to adults, causing shunt
    * Functional residual capacity is unchanged
    * Tidal volume and dead space are unchanged
* **Laryngeal anatomy**
    * Large head
    * Large tongue
    * Large, stiff, U-shaped epiglottis
    * Elevated larynx\
    Glottis is at C-3C4 (C6 in adults).
    * Upper airway is narrowest at the cricoid ring (rather than the glottis).
    * Trachea is shorter and narrower\
    4-5cm long, 6mm diameter in the neonate.
* **Small airways**\
    * Reduced bronchial smooth muscle so bronchospasm is uncommon
    * Bronchioles contribute 50% of airways resistance\
    Bronchiolitis much more distressing in neonates and children.
