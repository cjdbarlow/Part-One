Shunt is blood reaching the systemic circulation without being oxygenated via passage through the lungs.

## Factors Contributing to Shunt

* Normal shunt
    * Anatomical shunt
        * Thebesian veins, which drain directly into the left cardiac chambers
        * Bronchial circulations, which drain into the pulmonary veins
    * Functional shunt\
    Blood draining through alveoli with a V/Q between 0 and 1.
        * This may not be true shunt, as blood may have some oxygen content but not be maximally oxygenated
* Pathological shunt\
Pathological shunting can be anatomical (e.g congenital cardiac malformations), or physiological (e.g. pneumonia causing alveolar consolidation).
    * Intra-cardiac\
    e.g. VSD
    * Extra-cardiac\
    e.g. Pulmonary AVM, PDA\

## Calculation of Shunt

* Shunt cannot be directly measured
* This is because we cannot separate true shunt (V = 0) from V/Q scatter (V/Q < 1) when sampling blood entering the left heart
* **Venous admixture** is used instead\
Venous admixture is **the amount of mixed venous blood that must be added to pulmonary end-capillary blood to give the observed arterial oxygen *content***. Venous admixture:
  * Is a calculated, theoretical value
  * Assumes that alveoli have either complete shunt (no ventilation at all, i.e. V/Q = 0) or no shunt (V/Q = 1)
  * Is expressed as a ratio, or **shunt fraction**:\
  ${\dot{Q}_S \over \dot{Q}_T }= {C_cO_2 - C_aO_2 \over C_cO_2 - C_vO_2}$, where:
    * $\dot{Q}_S$ is Shunt blood flow
    * $\dot{Q}_T$ is Cardiac output
    * $C_cO_2$ is Pulmonary end-capillary oxygen content, assumed to have an oxygen tension equal to PAO~2~ (with the corresponding oxygen saturation)
    * $C_aO_2$ is Arterial oxygen content
    * $C_vO_2$ is Mixed venous oxygen content


## Physiological Consequences of Shunt

### Effect on Carbon Dioxide

* No CO~2~ can diffuse from shunted blood
* Therefore PaCO~2~ might be expected to rise, however:
    * In a spontaneously breathing patient the increased PaCO~2~ increases respiratory drive, and alveolar ventilation increases
        * Therefore, **shunt does not tend to increase PaCO~2~** unless:
            * The shunt fraction is large and 
            * The patient is unable to increase their alveolar ventilation to compensate
    * Additionally, the steepness of the CO~2~ dissociation curve at the arterial point means that although CO~2~ *content* increases, the increase in PaCO~2~ is small

### Effect on Oxygen

* **PaO~2~ falls proportionally to shunt fraction**
* As shunted alveoli are perfused but not ventilated, **true shunt** is said to be **unresponsive to an increase in FiO~2~**\
This is where technical definitions become important to avoid confusion.
    * For an alveolus with a V/Q between 0-1 (V/Q mismatch or V/Q scatter, but not true shunt):
        * There is perfusion, but *relatively less* ventilation
        * Therefore blood passing through this alveolus will be *partially* oxygenated
        * Increasing PAO~2~ will improve oxygenation (assuming no diffusion limitation):
            * Administration of supplemental oxygen
            * Hyperventilation\
        * As per the alveolar gas equation
    * For an alveoli with a V/Q of 0 (true shunt)\
    There is no ventilation. Regardless of the increase in PAO~2~, PaO~2~ will not improve.


#### The Isoshunt Diagram

* Isoshunt diagram plots the relationship between FiO~2~ and PaO~2~ against a set of 'virtual shunt lines'
* These 'shunt fractions' are calculated from the above equation and so are actually V/Q admixture fractions
