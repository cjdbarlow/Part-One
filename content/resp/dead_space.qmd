# Dead Space

:::CICM
Define dead space and its components. Explain how these may be measured and describe the physiological impact of increased dead space.
:::

:::ANZCA
Discuss dead space, its measurement and apply the Bohr equation and alveolar gas equation
:::

Dead space is the proportion of minute ventilation which does not participate in gas exchange.

## Types of Dead Space

Dead space can be divided into:

::: column-margin
Note that West Zone 1 (where PA > Pa > Pv) physiology is increased dead space.
:::

* **Apparatus dead space**\
Dead space from equipment, such as tubes ventilator circuitry. Some apparatus dead space may actually *reduce* total dead space, as an ETT bypasses the majority of anatomical dead space of the patient (nasopharynx).
* **Physiological dead space**\
  Dead space from the patient. Physiological dead space is divided into:
  * **Anatomical dead space**\
  The volume of the conducting zone of the lung. Anatomical dead space is affected by:
    * Size and Age\
    3.3ml.kg^-1^ in the infant, falls to 2.2ml.kg^-1^ in the adult
    * Posture\
      Decreases when supine.
    * Position of the neck and jaw\
      Increased with neck extension.
    * Lung volumes\
      Increases by ~20ml per litre of additional lung volume.
    * Airway calibre\
    Bronchodilation increases airway diameter and therefore V~D~.
    <br>
  * **Pathological/Alveolar Dead Space**  \
  Dead space caused by disease. Causes of pathological dead space include:
    * Erect posture
    * Decreased pulmonary artery pressure/impaired pulmonary blood flow\
      * Hypovolaemia
      * RV failure/Increased RV afterload:
        * HPV
        * MI
      * PE
    * Increased alveolar pressure\
    Increases West Zone 1 physiology.
     * PEEP
    * COAD

## Calculation of Dead Space

Two methods exist to allow dead space volumes to be calculated:

* Physiological dead space may be measured with **Bohr's method**
* Anatomical dead space may be measured by **Fowler's method**
* Pathological dead space may be calculated by subtracting anatomical dead space (Fowler's method) from physiological dead space (Bohr's Method)

### Fowler's Method

Fowler's Method is a **single-breath nitrogen washout test**, used to calculate **anatomical dead space** and **closing *volume***.

<img src="/resources/fowlers-method.svg">

Method:

* At the end of a normal tidal breath (at FRC) a **vital-capacity breath of 100% oxygen** is taken
* The patient then exhales to RV\
Expired nitrogen concentration and volume is measured.
* A plot of expired nitrogen concentration by volume is generated, producing a graph with four phases:
  * Phase 1 (Pure Dead Space)\
  Gas from the anatomical dead space is expired. This contains 100% oxygen - no nitrogen is present.
  * Phase 2\
  A mix of anatomical dead space and alveolar (lung units with short time constants) is expired. The midpoint of phase 2 (when area A = area B) is the volume of the **anatomical dead space**.
  * Phase 3\
  Expired nitrogen reaches a plateau as just alveolar gas is exhaled (lung units with variable time constants).
  * Phase 4\
  Sudden increase in nitrogen concentration.
    * Occurs because:
      * Basal alveoli are more compliant than apical alveoli
      * Therefore, during inspiration basal alveoli inflate more than apical alveoli\
      The single 100% oxygen breath therefore preferentially inflates the basal alveoli. At the end of the vital capacity breath, the oxygen concentration in basal alveoli is greater than that of apical alveoli.
      * In expiration, the process is reversed:
          * Basal alveoli preferentially exhale
          * At closing capacity, small basal airways close and now only apical alveoli (with a higher concentration of nitrogen) can exhale
          * Measured expired nitrogen concentration increases
    * Onset of phase 4 indicates the point at which **closing capacity** is reached\
    * The volume exhaled between phase 4 commencing and reaching RV is the **closing volume**\
    This can be combined with a measurement of RV to quantify the closing capacity.


### Bohr's Method

::: column-margin
A **normal** value for physiological dead space during normal tidal breathing is **0.2-0.35**
:::

Physiological dead space is measured using the Bohr equation. This calculates dead space as a ratio, or as a proportion of tidal volume:

$${V_D \over V_T} = {V_T - V_A \over V_T}$$

The Bohr equation is based on the principle that **all CO~2~ exhaled must come from ventilated alveoli**.

::: column-margin
The PaCO~2~-ETCO~2~ difference is a consequence of dead space, as dead space gas dilutes alveolar gas
:::

$${V_D \over V_T} = {PA_{CO_2} - P\bar{E}_{CO_2} \over PA_{CO_2}}$$

Note that:

* $P\bar{E}_{CO_2}$ is the mixed-expired carbon dioxide\
Partial pressure of CO~2~ in an expired tidal breath.
* The Bohr equation requires alveolar PCO~2~ to be measured\
As this is impractical, the **Enghoff modification** is typically used, which assumes that PACO~2~ â‰ˆ PaCO~2~. The equation then becomes:\
$${V_D \over V_T} = {Pa_{CO_2} - P\bar{E}_{CO_2} \over Pa_{CO_2}}$$

## Physiological Consequences of Increased Dead Space

In dead space:

* The V/Q ratio approaches infinity as alveolar **perfusion** falls
* This results in a rise in PaCO~2~
* In a spontaneously-ventilating individual, this stimulates the respiratory centre to increase minute ventilation to return alveolar ventilation (and therefore CO~2~) to normal
* There is minimal effect on PaO~2~, as in pure dead space all blood is passing through ventilated alveoli and therefore undergoes gas exchange

### Relationship between Alveolar Ventilation and PaCO~2~

Atmospheric air contains negligible CO~2~. As MV increases, PaCO~2~ will fall, as will the gradient for further CO~2~ diffusion. This can be expressed by the equation:
$$PaCO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$$

<img src="/resources/VA-vs-paco2.svg">

Note that this graph:

* Describes the change in PaCO~2~ for a change in alveolar ventilation\
A doubling of alveolar ventilation will halve PaCO~2~.
* Does not describe the change in ventilatory drive for a given change in PaCO~2~\
This is covered under [removal of CO~2~](carbon_dioxide_transport.md#tr).
