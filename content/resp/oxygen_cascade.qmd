# Oxygen Cascade

:::dual
Describe and explain the oxygen cascade
:::

The **oxygen cascade** describes the **passive transfer**^[**Partial pressure** is the determinant of rate and extent of gas transfer, **but perfusion** depends on **oxygen content**] of oxygen down a series of **partial pressure gradient** from air to mitochondria:

* Dry atmospheric gas
* Humidified tracheal gas
* Alveolar gas
* Arterial blood
* Mitochondria
* Venous blood

## Atmospheric Gas

Atmospheric partial pressure of oxygen is a function of barometric pressure and the FiO~2~:

* $PO_2 = P_B \times FiO_2$, where:
    * $P_B$ is 760mmHg
    * $FiO_2$ is 0.21
* Therefore, atmospheric $PO_2$ at sea level is **160mmHg**

## Humidified Tracheal Gas

* Gas is humidified during inspiration
* Gas in the proximal trachea is **heated to 37°C** and has **100% relative humidity**
* The **saturated vapour pressure** of water at 37°C is **47mmHg**
* Therefore:\
$PO_2 = (P_B - P_{SVP \ of \ Water}) \times FiO_2$, where:
    * $P_B$and $FiO_2$are as above
    * $PO_2$is **149mmHg**


## Alveolar Gas

**Ideal alveolar PO~2~** is calculated using the **alveolar gas equation**:

$$P_AO_2 = P_iO_2 - {P_aCO_2 \over R} + F$$

Where:

* $P_AO_2$ is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
* $P_iO_2$ is the inspired partial pressure of oxygen
* $P_aCO_2$ is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
* $R$ is the respiratory quotient, where $R = {Volume \ of \ CO_2 \ produced \over Volume \ of \ O_2 \ consumed}$
    * R is used in the alveolar gas equation to correct for the change in inspired relative to expired volume\
    As generally less CO~2~ is produced than O~2~ consumed, expired volumes are typically less than inspired volumes
    * R is dependent on the metabolic substrates used for metabolism: 
        * Pure fat ≈ 0.7
        * Pure protein ≈ 0.9
        * Pure carbohydrate ≈ 1
        * The normal value for a Western diet is quoted as **0.8**
  * $F$ is a correction factor, usually equal to ~2mmHg, and is given by $F = P_ACO_2.FiO_2.{1 - R \over R}$


Alveolar oxygen is therefore dependent on:

* PiO~2~, which is a function of:
    * FiO~2~
    * Air pressure
* Alveolar ventilation\
As $P_aO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$.


## Arterial Blood

The difference in partial pressure of oxygen between alveolar and arterial blood is called the **A-a gradient**:
$$A–a \ gradient = PAO_2 - PaO_2 = PiO_2 - {PaCO_2 \over R}  - PaO_2$$


* The normal A-a gradient is ${Age \over 4} + 4$\
Therefore, the normal arterial PO~2~ in a Standard Guyton Man is 100mmHg.
* The drop in PO~2~ is due to:
    * Shunt/VQ scatter\
    A physiological right-to-left shunt is normal due to blood from the bronchial circulation and thebesian veins draining into the left heart.
    * Physiological V/Q mismatch^[<img src="/resources/regional-ventilation-and-perfusion.svg">]
 
## Mitochondria

* PO~2~ varies with metabolic activity, but typically quoted as 5mmHg
* The **Pasteur point** is the partial pressure of oxygen at which oxidative phosphorylation ceases, and is **~1mmHg**

## Venous Blood

* PO~2~ is greater than mitochondrial PO~2~\
Mixed venous blood typically quoted as 40mmHg.
* Higher than mitochondria as not all arterial blood travels through capillary beds
