Ventilation is controlled by a feedback loop involving:

* Inputs
* Integration and control centres
* Effectors

## Inputs

Inputs to the respiratory centre comes from a number of sensors:

* Chemoreceptors\
Chemoreceptors act synergistically. Chemoreceptors are divided into:
    * Peripheral
    * Central
* Mechanoreceptors
* Other effects

### Peripheral Chemoreceptors

Peripheral chemoreceptors are divided into:

* The **carotid body**\
Located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, and are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).
* The **aortic body**\
Located in the aortic arch, and innervated by the vagus (CN X).

Peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by:

* **Low PaO~2~**^[<img src="resources/PaO2-vs-MV.svg">]\
Peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by **low O~2~ tension**\
* **High PaCO~2~**^[<img src="resources/paco2-vs-MV.svg">]\
Peripheral receptors have a **rapid** (~1-3s) but **weaker** (~20% of response) to changes in CO~2~, compared to central chemoreceptors\
* **Acidaemia**\
(Carotid bodies only)
* **Hypotension** 

### Central Chemoreceptors

* Central chemoreceptors are located on the **ventral medulla**, and are **stimulated** by a **fall** in **CSF pH**
  * H^+^ and HCO~3~^-^ are ionised, and cannot cross the BBB by diffusion
  * Because of this, central chemoreceptors **respond indirectly** to **changes in arterial PaCO~2~**
    * Carbon dioxide is lipid soluble and freely diffuses into CSF
    * In CSF, carbon dioxide combines with water (catalysed by carbonic anhydrase) to form H^+^ and HCO~3~^-^


* This gives the central chemoreceptors a number of special properties:
  * **Increased sensitivity**\
  Increased relative to plasma due to minimal buffering (as there is less protein in CSF)
  * **Respond to respiratory acidosis**\
  Fixed acid does not cross the blood brain barrier and so have a minimal response on CSF pH. **Cerebral hypoxia** increases **CSF lactate**, which will stimulate respiration.

### Mechanism of CO~2~ Retention

* Prolonged respiratory acidosis (i.e. prolonged CSF acidosis) stimulates active secretion of bicarbonate into the CSF
* When pH normalises, the stimulation of central chemoreceptors ceases
* Similarly, renal absorption of bicarbonate increases, which normalises arterial pH and reduces peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation

### Mechanoreceptors

Stretch receptors in bronchial muscle are stimulated by overinflation, and stimulate the **apneustic centre** to reduce inspiratory volumes. This is the **Hering-Breuer reflex**.

### Other Stimulants

Other inputs which stimulate respiration include:

* Juxtacapillary receptors (J-receptors)\
Receptors in alveolar walls, potentially stimulated by oedema and emboli.
* Irritant receptors\
  Inhalation of noxious gases stimulates respiration.
* Pain receptors
* Thalamus\
  Increased core temperature stimulates respiration.
* Limbic system\
  Emotional responses.
* Cerebral cortex\
  Conscious control of breathing.
* Muscle spindles\
Ventilatory response to exercise.

## Integration and Control

The respiratory centre is located in the **medulla** and the **pons**. It consists of four groups:

* **Dorsal Respiratory Group (DRG)**\
  Controls the diaphragm, and is so only involved with inspiration.
* **Ventral Respiratory Group (VRG)**\
  Controls the intercostal muscles, and so is involved in inspiration and expiration.
* **Apneustic Centre**\
  Modulates DRG function to prevent over-expansion. Loss of this area causes **apneusis** - long, deep breaths.
* **Pneumotaxic Centre**\
 Also modulates the DRG, increasing RR and decreasing V~T~ to maintain MV.
