# Cough Reflex

:::CICM
Explain the pathways and importance of the cough reflex
:::

Coughing:

* Is an **airway protection** reflex
* Involves deep inspiration followed by **forced expiration against a closed glottis**\
The sudden opening of the cords causes a violent rush of air at **>900km.h^-1^**, removing irritants and secretions from the airways.

## Sensation

Vagus afferents have exquisitely sensitive light touch and corrosive chemical receptors in the larynx, carina, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli.

## Integration

Vagal afferents synapse in the medulla, which coordinates the effector response.

## Effector

A series of processes occur in three phases:

* Inspiratory phase\
A close to vital capacity breath is taken.
* Compressive phase\
Effort closure of the epiglottis to seal the larynx, followed by a violent contraction of abdominal musculature and internal intercostals, causing a rapid rise in intrapleural pressure to >100mmHg.
* Expulsive phase\
Wide-opening of the cords and epiglottis, causing a violent expiration.
    * Compression of the lungs causes narrowing of the noncartilaginous airways and increases turbulent flow, removing adherent material from the tracheobronchial tree
