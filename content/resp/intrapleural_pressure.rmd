Explain the vertical gradient of pleural pressure and its significance

**Intrapleural pressure** (P~Pl~) is the pressure in airtight the space between the visceral and parietal pleura, or (physiologically) between the lungs and the chest wall. Intrapleural pressure:

* Is usually **negative**, typically **-5cmH~2~O at rest**\
Balance between the:
  * Outwards recoil of the chest wall
  * Inwards recoil of the lungs (**P~el~**)
* Varies with vertical distance in the lung\
  * Gravity pulls the lung parenchyma inferiorly
  * Intrapleural pressure is therefore:
    *  **More negative** in the **apex**\
    Typically **-10cmH~2~O** at FRC
    * **Less negative** in the **base**\
    Typically **-3cmH~2~O** at FRC
* This changes the degree of inflation at FRC
  * Apical alveoli are maximally inflated
  * Basal alveoli are relatively deflated
* **Changes over the respiratory cycle**, which drives **change in lung volume** and therefore **breathing**
  * An airtight pleura is required, so that the trachea is the only route through which gas can enter or exit the lung
  * During inspiration, the pleural pressure changes evenly throughout the lung, however the basal alveoli are better ventilated because their compliance is increased (due to lower resting volume)

## Inspiration

* Diaphragmatic and external intercostal/accessory muscle contraction causes an increase in the volume of the thorax
* Intrapleural pressure becomes more negative, typically to **-8-10cmH~2~O**
* When P~pl~ > P~el~, the lungs expands
* Alveolar pressure (P~A~) becomes sub-atmospheric, and inspiration occurs
* At end inspiration:
  * P~pl~ = P~el~
  * P~A~ = P~atmospheric~
 

## Expiration

* Muscular relaxation causes the chest wall to passively return to their resting position
* Thoracic volume falls
* P~pl~ falls to -5cmH~2~O
* The elastic recoil of the lung causes it to collapse until P~A~ = P~atmospheric~
