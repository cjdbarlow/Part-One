# Altitude

Altitude causes a number of physiological effects, related to:

* Reduce atmospheric pressure
* Reduced temperature
* Reduced relative humidity
* Increased solar radiation

## Pressure Effects

Reduced air pressure results in a proportional decrease in PO~2~:

* At 3,000m, alveolar PO~2~ is 60mmHg
* At 5,400m, consciousness is lost in unacclimatised individuals
* At 10,400m, air pressure is 187mmHg\
With 47mmHg of water vapour and an alveolar PCO~2~ of 40, breathing 100% O~2~ gives an alveolar PO~2~ of 100mmHg.
* At 14,000m, consciousness is lost despite 100% O~2~
* At 19,200m, the ambient pressure is so low that the boiling point of water is 37Â°C\
This is the **Armstrong limit**.

### Respiratory

* Fall in PaO~2~ is compensated by increasing minute ventilation, which decreases PACO~2~ and therefore increases PAO~2~
  * Limits of compensation are reached on 100% oxygen at 13,700m
* Effective compensation is limited by the respiratory alkalosis, this is known as the **braking effect**:
  * Peripheral chemoreceptors detect hypocapnea
  * Central chemoreceptors detect alkalosis
* The subsequent respiratory alkalosis generates a compensatory metabolic acidosis\
This acidosis relaxes the braking effect and allows further hyperventilation, and is therefore am important part of acclimatisation.


* There is an **initial left-shift** of the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve due to alkalosis
* This stimulates a compensatory increase in 2,3-DPG to right-shift the curve and improve oxygen offloading at the tissues

### Cardiovascular

* PVR increases due to HPV
* Heart rate increases due to increased SNS outflow
* Stroke volume falls (cardiac output remains the same) due to decreased preload:
  * Plasma volume falls due to:
    * Pressure diuresis
    * Insensible losses from hyperventilation and reduce relative humidity
* Myocardial work increases
    * Increased HR
    * Increased viscosity of blood due to high haematocrit
    * Increased RV afterload from high PVR\
    Increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressures lead to fluid transudation and pulmonary oedema

### Haematological

* Increased risk of thrombotic events to due increased haematocrit
* Increased red cell mass due to EPO secretion
