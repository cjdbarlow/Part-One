# Chest Wall and Diaphragm

:::CICM
Describe the structure of the chest wall and diaphragm and to relate these to respiratory mechanics.

:::ANZCA
Discuss the structure of the chest wall and diaphragm and the implications for respiratory mechanics
:::

Mechanics of breathing depend on the:

* Chest wall
    * **Ribs**\
    Slope antero-inferiorly, and are connected by the external, internal, and innermost intercostal muscles.
    * **Intercostal muscles**\
        * External intercostals slope antero-inferiorly
        * Internal and innermost intercostals slope infero-posteriorly
* **Diaphragm**\
Complex dome-shaped membranous structure, consisting of a central tendon and peripheral muscles
    * Performs the majority of inspiratory work of breathing
    * Able to dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure, so is essential in:
        *  Coughing
        *  Vomiting
        *  Sneezing
    * Role in maintaining lower oesophageal sphincter tone
    * It has three perforations:
        * **T8** for the **vena cava** (eight letters)
        * **T10** for the **oesophagus** (ten letters)
        * **T12** for the **aorta**, thoracic duct, and azygos vein

## Inspiration

* During **inspiration**, the **diaphragm** and **external intercostal** muscles **contract**
  * Diaphragm pushes the intraabdominal contents down, increasing thoracic volume and generating a negative intrathoracic pressure
    * Diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves from C3/4/5. 
  * External intercostals pull the ribs antero-superiorly, which increases the cross-sectional area of the chest, further increasing thoracic volume (and negative pressure)
    * Intercostal muscles are supplied by intercostal nerves from the same spinal level
    * Paralysis of the external intercostals does not have a dramatic effect on inspiratory function provided the diaphragm is intact


* **Accessory muscles** include **sternocleidomastoid** and the **scalene**, which elevate the sternum and first two ribs respectively. They are active in hyperventilation.

## Expiration

* Expiration is passive during quiet breathing as elastic recoil of the lung will return them to FRC
* When minute ventilation is high, expiration becomes an an active process:
  * **Abdominal wall** muscles (rectus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, transversus abdominis) contract, raising intraabdominal pressure and forcing the diaphragm up
  * **Internal** and **innermost** intercostals contract, pulling the ribs **downwards** and **inwards**, further decreasing thoracic volume

## Respiratory Mechanics in Spinal Injury

:::

* Paralysis of the abdominal wall muscles (e.g. spinal injury) has significant effect on respiratory mechanics
    * In the initial phases of injury, spinal shock results in a flaccid paralysis of the abdominal wall
        * Intraabdominal pressure is low, and so the diaphragm moves inferiorly\
        This results in a higher FRC but limits tidal volumes, as contraction of the diaphragm only increase thoracic volume by a small fraction.
    * Nursing in a supine position causes the abdominal contents to push the diaphragm superiorly, causing:
        * Lower FRC
        * Greater proportional expansion with respiration, improving tidal volumes
  * Once spastic paralysis ensues, the abdominal wall is rigid and the patient can be sat up
