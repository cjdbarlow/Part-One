The derivation of $W = PV$ is as follows.\
\
Work is classically defined as: $$W = FD$$
Where:\
- $W$ is Work in Joules\
- $F$ is Force in Newtons\
- $D$ is Distance in Metres\
- $V$ is Volume in Litres\
\
Pressure is defined as: $$P = {F \over A}$$
Where:\
- $P$ = Pressure in Pascals\
- $A$ = Area in metres squared\
\
Rearranging:
$$F = PA$$
Substituting:\

$$
\begin{align*}
W &= PAD \\
W &= PV \\
\end{align*}
$$

Work of breathing is the energy used by the muscles for respiration. It is defined as: $Work = Pressure \times Volume$:

* This gives the work for a single respiratory cycle\
Energy expenditure over time is better described as the "power of breathing", as $Power = {Work \over Time}$ or **rate of work**, and is measured in Watts.
* It does not take into account **respiratory rate** or **flow rate**\
These factors have a significant effect on energy requirement  
    * Tidal breathing is efficient and uses < 2% of BMR
* The oxygen requirement of breathing at rest is ~2-5% of VO~2~, or ~3ml.min^-1^

## Determinants of Work of Breathing

Work of breathing is divided into:

Airway generation and resistance: <img src="/resources/airway-gen-vs-resistance.svg">
:::

* **Elastic work**\
About 65% of total work, and is stored as elastic potential energy. Energy required to overcome elastic forces:
  * Lung elastic recoil
  * Surface tension of alveoli
* **Resistive work**\
About 35% of total work, and is lost as heat. This is due to the energy required to overcome frictional forces:
    * Between tissues
        * Increased with increased interstitial lung tissue
    * Between gas molecules
        * Increased at high flow rates
        * Increased with turbulent flow
            * High respiratory rates
            * Upper airway obstruction
        * Increased airway density
             * Hyperbaric
            * Diving
    * Increased with decreased airway radius 
        * Low lung volume
            * Inadequate PEEP
            * Decreased respiratory muscle tone
        * Bronchoconstriction
        * Dynamic airway compression\
        Effort-independent expiration.
        * Apparatus
            * Endotracheal Tube
            * HME filters
        * Airway division
            * Resistance peaks at the 3rd airway division (lobar bronchi)
            * Falls with increasing airway divisions due to increased cross-sectional area



### Graphing Work of Breathing

Work of breathing can be evaluated with a dynamic lung compliance curve:

::: column-margin
Active expiratory work:<img src="/resources/workofbreathing-obstructive.svg">
:::

* If there **were no resistive forces**, then this curve would be a straight line
    * The triangular area is the elastic work done
* The resistive work of breathing causes the deviation of the inspiratory and expiratory lines:
    * The area between the compliance line and the inspiratory line is additional **resistive inspiratory** work done
    * The area between the compliance line and expiratory line is additional **resistive expiratory** work done
        * This work is typically done by elastic recoil of the lungs
        * If this area falls within the area of elastic work of breathing, it is a purely passive process, using the stored elastic potential energy of inspiration
        * If part of this area falls outside the area of elastic work of breathing, it demonstrates additional **active work of expiration** which may occur in obstructive lung disease or when minute ventilation is high


### Minimising Work of Breathing

Work of breathing can be minimised by optimising the determinants:

* Elastic work
    * PEEP\
    Keep lung volume at FRC and maximise number of ventilated alveoli.
    * Positioning\
    Optimise lung volume.
    * Surfactant\
    Minimising surface tension.
    * Optimise respiratory rate\
    Elastic work of breathing typically decreases with increased respiratory rate.
* Resistive work\
    * Decrease respiratory rate\
    Respiratory rate is directly proportional to resistive work.
    * Increase laminar flow\
    Laminar flow is more efficient than turbulent flow. Laminar flow can be increased by:
        * Reducing gas density\
        Heliox.
    * Increase Radius\
        * Increase lung volume
        * Bronchodilators\
