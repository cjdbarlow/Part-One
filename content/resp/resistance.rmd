Resistance (measured in cmH~2~O.L^-1^.sec^-1^) comprises the energy lost as frictional and inertial impedance to gas flow, where energy is lost as heat. Flow is a function of pressure gradient, resistance, and type of flow.

## Types of Flow

Flow can be either laminar or turbulent. In laminar conditions flow is proportional to driving pressure, whilst in turbulent conditions flow is proportional to the square root of driving pressure.

### Reynolds' Number

Type of flow can be predicted by **Reynolds's Number**, a dimensionless index:

$$Reynolds' \ Number = {2r.d.v \over \eta}$$

Where:

* $r$= Radius
* $d$= Gas density
* $v$= Velocity
* $\eta$= Gas viscosity

A Reynolds' Number of <2000 suggests flow is predominantly laminar, whilst >4000 suggests flow is predominantly turbulent.

### Laminar Flow

In laminar flow:

* Gas moves in a series of concentric cylinders which slide over one another\
    * Gas in the centre moves **twice as fast** compared to the outside, where it is almost stationary
* Gas appears in cross-section as an **advancing cone**\
Gas may reach the end of the tube when the volume of flow is less than the volume of the tube.
    * This is the mechanism of alveolar ventilation when tidal volumes are less than anatomical dead space volume


In a straight unbranched tube, flow can be quantified by the **Hagen-Poiseuille Equation**:

$$F = {\Delta P \pi r^4 \over 8l.\eta}$$

Where:

* $F$= Flow
* $\Delta P$= Driving pressure
* $r$= Radius
* $l$= Length
* $\eta$= Viscosity


However, as in laminar conditions flow is proportional to the driving pressure and inversely proportional to resistance, flow can be substituted and the equation solved for resistance:

$$Resistance = { 8l. \eta \over \pi r^4}$$

This form of the equation can be used to illustrate the **factors affecting resistance**:

* **Length**\
Fixed constant.
* **Viscosity**\
Varies with the particular gas mixture being used.
* **Radius**\
Main determinant. May be divided into:
    * **Extraluminal factors**
        * Compression:
        * Haemorrhage, tumour, dynamic hyperinflation, atelectasis compressing airways, etc.
    * Lung volume:
        * Airway radius increases when lung volume expands due to radial traction on airways (until dynamic hyperinflation occurs, at which point airways are compressed again)
    * **Luminal constriction**\
    Bronchospasm, bronchoconstriction.
    * **Intraluminal obstruction**\
    Sputum plugging, aspiration.

Note that airway resistance:

* **Peaks** at the **5^th^** generation
* Rapidly **decreases** with each airway division thereafter\
This is due to the total cross-sectional area increasing dramatically.

* Reduces with increasing lung volume, as radial tension distends airways, increasing their cross sectional area

### Turbulent Flow

High flow rates and branching of airways disrupt disciplined laminar flow. Turbulent flow is:

* Dominant in the upper airway (where velocity is high)
* Dominant in early-generation airways due to regular branching, changes in diameter, and sharp angles
* Reduces after the **11th generation** bronchioles
* Proportional to the square root of the driving pressure\
Therefore, **resistance is higher in turbulent flow** than in laminar flow.
    * Driving pressure is proportional to gas density, and independent of viscosity

Resistance in turbulent flow is managed by making flow less turbulent:\

* Achieved by reducing Reynolds number
    * Helium mixtures reduce gas density\
    Of greater benefit in upper airway than lower airway disease.

### Transitional Flow

Transitional flow is the change between laminar and turbulent flow. It occurs at branches and angles in the airways, seen in most of the bronchial tree.
