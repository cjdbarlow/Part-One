Describe the properties, production and regulation of, surfactant and relate these to its role in influencing respiratory mechanics

## Surface Tension

* Surface tension describes the tendency of a fluid to minimise its surface area
* It is related to the attraction between particles in the fluid relative to particles outside the fluid
* Surface tension is why:
    * Water scattered on a surface forms rounded droplets
    * Why multiple droplets will tend to coalesce into a single larger droplet


* This relationship is described by **Laplace's Law**\
$P = {2T\Theta \over r}$, where:
    * $P$ is pressure
    * $T$ is wall thickness\
    * $\Theta$ is surface tension
    * $r$ is radius


* Alveoli obey Laplace's Law
* High surface tension causes three problems with alveoli
    * Compliance falls when the alveolus is empty\
    As the radius falls, the pressure required to open it (at a given surface tension) will be increased. This increases work of breathing.
    * Smaller alveoli will preferentially empty into bigger alveoli\
    Smaller alveoli require greater transmural pressures to remain inflated. This causes smaller alveoli to empty into larger ones.
    * Fluid transudation\
    Surface tension draws fluid from interstitial spaces and contributes to pulmonary oedema.
 * Overall, high surface tension is detrimental to the lungs

## Surfactant

* Surfactant is a substance which substantially reduces work of breathing by reducing alveolar surface tension
* Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar cells in response to lung inflation and respiration
* It is composed of:
  *  85% phospholipid
  *  5% neutral lipid
  *  10% protein
* Surfactant is **amphipathic**\
Each component has a hydrophobic and hydrophilic end.
  * This causes the molecules to orient themselves along the air-liquid interface, disrupting the attractive bonds between water molecules
  * Surface tension is reduced in proportion to the concentration of molecules
* The concentration of surfactant changes throughout the respiratory cycle
  * During expiration alveoli collapse\
  The decrease in alveolar radius is offset by the increase in surfactant concentration, so the fall in radius is mitigated by the drop in surface tension.
