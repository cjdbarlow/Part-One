# Position and Ventilation

:::CICM
Explain the effect of changes in posture on ventilatory function
:::

Altered patient position can cause significant changes to V/Q matching. In general:

* The dependent lung has increased perfusion independent of anaesthesia, paralysis, or ventilation method
* The independent lung has progressively more ventilation through each of:
    * Spontaneous ventilation
    * Controlled ventilation
    * Thoracotomy


## Factors Affecting Distribution of Blood Flow

Key factors:

* Gravity\
* HPV
* Anatomy
Blood flow is greater in central than peripheral portions. 
* Airway pressures\
Due to effects on:
    * Volume\
    Via:
        * Altering vascular distension and subsequently PVR
        * Alterations is extra-alveolar and intra-alveolar pressures at FRC may alter regional blood flow.
    * Right ventricular afterload
        * Lung volume
* When both lungs are being ventilated, V/Q matching can be improved with selective application of PEEP to the dependent lung, which improves compliance

## Factors Affecting Distribution of Ventilation

Key factors:

* Gravity\
Intrapleural pressure is more negative in the elevated portions of the lung, due to the weight of the lung pulling down. This results in:
    * **Larger intra-alveolar volume** of the upper portion of the lung, and **reduced compliance**
    * **Smaller intra-alveolar volume** of the dependent portion of the lung, and **improved compliance**
    * Which results in the upper portion of the lung being higher on the compliance curve
    * Reducing the relative contribution of this portion of the lung to a tidal volume, and relatively reduced ventilation\
    These changes may be exaggerated in disease, e.g. COPD.

## Lateral Decubitus

Effects depends on the method of ventilation:

* In the **spontaneously ventilating** patient:
    * Dependent lung ventilation and perfusion improves by ~10%\
    Due to the effect of gravity.
    * Dependent lung corresponds more to West Zone 3
    * Non-dependent lung corresponds more to West Zone 2
* In the **anaesthetised patient**:
    * FRC â†“ by ~20% in both lungs due to reduced muscle tone\
    Each lung therefore changes in compliance:
        * Non-dependent lung falls to the steep portion of the curve, and compliance improves\
        * The dependent lung falls from the steep position to the lower shallow segment, and compliance decreases\
        **Ventilation** is now directed preferentially to the **non-dependent lung**.
        * Perfusion is unchanged
* In the paralysed and **positively-pressure ventilated** patient:
    * FRC reduces further due to cephalad movement of:
        * Mediastinum
        * Abdominal organs\
    * Ventilation is further directed to the non-dependent lung
    * Distribution of perfusion is unaffected, but the application of PEEP increases dead space and further worsens V/Q matching


### Thoracotomy

Opening the non-dependent hemithorax causes:

* No change in perfusion pressure\
Unless mediastinal structures move.
* Variable effects on the lung:\
    * If lung isolation:
        * Lung will collapse under its own elastic recoil\
        Improved V/Q matching, as there is no ventilation, and perfusion will decrease as the lung collapses.
    * If no lung isolation:
        * Expansion of the lung, now unrestrained by the chest wall\
        Worse V/Q matching.
