The airway can be functionally divided into the:

* Upper airway
* Lower airway
* Alveolus

## Upper Airway

The upper airway consists of the:

* **Mouth**
* **Nasal cavity**\
  * Hairs filter large particles
  * Olfactory receptors detect harmful gases prior to inhalation
* **Pharyngeal structures**
    * Pharynx
    * Larynx


### Nasal Cavity

The nasal cavity provides:

* Good **humidification** and **filtration** of inhaled particles because the septum and turbinates have:
    * High mucosal surface area
    * High mucosal blood flow
    * Generate turbulent flow
* High resistance to flow\
At a **high minute ventilation**, oral breathing is favoured.

### Pharyngeal Structures

* **Pharyngeal dilator muscles**\
Including genioglossus and levator palati. Prevent pharyngeal collapse during negative-pressure ventilation and during sleep.


* **Larynx**\
Important for **airway protection**, **speech**, and **effort closure**.
    * Prevents aspiration during swallowing by elevating the epiglottis and occluding of the aryepiglottic folds
    * **Phonation** is achieved by adjusting tension (and therefore resonance) of the vocal cords by action of the cricothyroid
    * During **inspiration**, **cricoarytenoid** muscles rotate the arytenoid cartilage and abduct the vocal cords to reduce resistance to airflow
    * During **expiration**, the **thyroarytenoid** muscles adduct the cords and increase resistance, providing **intrinsic PEEP**
        * 3-4 cmH~2~O of PEEP is generated
        * Maintains patency of small airways\
        Prevents alveolar collapse and therefore maintains FRC.
    * **Effort closure** is tighter occlusion of the laryngeal inlet, in which the aryepiglottic muscles contract strongly to act as a sphincter, allowing the airway to withstand up to 120cmH~2~O of pressure.


## Lower Airway

The lower airway consists of the:**tracheobronchial tree**, which is divided into two zones based on whether they contain alveoli and therefore are able to participate in gas exchange:

* The **conducting zone** is the first **16 divisions**^[There are a total of **23 divisions** in the lower airway.]
* The **respiratory zone** is the last 7 divisions

### Conducting Zone

The **first 16 divisions** constitute the **conducting zone**. Anatomically, the conducting zone consists of the:

* **Trachea**\
    * Mean diameter of 1.8 cm and a length of 11cm
    * D-shaped cross section\
    Curved cartilages anteriorly and longitudinal muscle (trachealis) posteriorly. External pressure of 40cmH~2~O is sufficient to occlude the extrathoracic trachea.
    * Flow is typically turbulent in the trachea and large airways
*  **Bronchi**
    * Comprise the first four divisions of the trachea
    * Right main bronchus is wider and deviates less from the axis of the trachea (the left main bronchus has a tighter turn over the heart), which is why foreign bodies will tend to the right side
    * The two main bronchi divide into a total of 5 lobar bronchi, which in turn divide into a total of 18 segmental bronchi
        * Right main bronchi is **~2cm** long
        * Left main bronchi is **~5cm** long
    * Cross-sectional area of the respiratory tract is lowest at the third division
        * These bronchi will collapse when intrathoracic pressure exceeds intraluminal pressure by ~5cmH~2~O.
        * Segmental bronchi^[Segmental bronchi are those that show peribronchial cuffing and perihilar haze on x-ray in early pulmonary oedema.] travel with branches of the pulmonary artery and lymphatics
        * Flow is typically transitional in the smaller bronchi and bronchioles
    * Contain **goblet cells** in the their walls which secrete **mucous**, which traps inhaled particles
    * Contain **cilia**, move rhythmically to drive the **mucociliary elevator**, driving mucous up to the epiglottis, where it is then swallowed or expectorated
*  **Bronchioles**\
    * Embedded in the lung parenchyma
    * Do not have cartilage in their walls to maintain patency - are held open by lung volume
    * Resistance to flow tends to be negligible due to large cross sectional area, unless there is spasm of helical muscle bands in bronchial wall
*  **Terminal bronchioles**
    * Flow may become laminar in the smallest bronchioles as flow decreases


Physiologically:

* Flow in the conducting zone during inspiration is fast and turbulent
* No gas exchange occurs in the conducting zone\
The volume of the conducting zone therefore contributes to **anatomic dead space**.
* Blood supply to the conducting zone is via the **bronchial circulation**

### Respiratory Zone

The **remaining 7 divisions** make up the **respiratory zone**. This region:

* Makes up the majority of lung volume\
All non-anatomical dead space volume is in the respiratory zone, and is **~30ml.kg^-1^** (FRC) at rest
* Blood supply is via the pulmonary circulation
* Gas flow in the terminal respiratory zone is slow due to the exponential increase in cross-sectional area with each airway division
    * Diffusion is the predominant mechanism of gas movement

## Alveolus

The alveolus is optimised for gas exchange:

* Spherical shape maximises surface area to volume ratio
* Total surface area of lung alveoli is 50-100m^2^
* Alveolar walls are extremely thin (0.2-0.3μm)\
Consequently, they are fragile and can be damaged by increases in capillary pressure
* Alveolar walls contain a dense mesh of capillaries **7 to 10μm** thick, which is just large enough for an erythrocyte to pass through\
The alveolar-capillary barrier consists of three layers:
    * Type I pneumocytes
    * Extracellular matrix
    * Pulmonary capillary endothelium


Alveoli are composed of three types of cells:

* **Type I pneumocytes**\
Thin-walled epithelial cells optimised for gas exchange.
  * Form ~90% of the alveolar surface area


* **Type II pneumocytes**\
Specialised secretory cells.
  * Secrete surfactant\
  Alveoli are inherently unstable, and surface tension of alveolar fluid favours collapse of the alveoli. **Surfactant** reduces surface tension, allowing the alveoli to expand.
  * Form ~10% of alveolar surface area


* **Alveolar macrophages**\
Alveoli have no cilia - inhaled particles are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in alveolar septa and lung interstitium.
