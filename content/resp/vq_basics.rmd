## (EMPTY) V/Q Relationships

# Basics of V/Q Matching

Optimal gas exchange occurs when regions of lung are ventilated in proportion to their perfusion, i.e. V/Q = 1.

Uneven distribution of ventilation and perfusion causes inefficient gas exchange:

* Excessive ventilation causes excessive work
* Inadequate ventilation causes inadequate gas exchange

## Distribution of Ventilation

* The right lung is slightly better ventilated than the left
* In an erect patient the bases of the lung are better ventilated\
The weight of lung above compresses the lung below, improving the compliance of dependent lung whilst stretching the non-dependent lung.
    * This is only significant at low inspiratory flow rates
    * The V/Q ratio in the bases is ~0.6
    * The V/Q ratio in the apices is >3
* In the lateral position:
    * The dependent lung is better ventilated in a spontaneously breathing patient
    * The non-dependent lung is better ventilated in a ventilated patient


## Distribution of Perfusion

* The pulmonary circulation is a low pressure circulation
* Gravity therefore has a substantial effect on fluid pressure
* Consequently, the distribution of blood throughout the lungs is uneven:
    * The **bases perfused better than the apices**\
    This is affected by lung volume, with the effect:
        * Becoming more pronounced at TLC (with apical perfusion falling precipitously)
        * Reversing slightly at RV

## V/Q Ratios

* The global V/Q ratio for normal resting lung is **0.9**
* The global V/Q ratio improves to 1.0 during exercise

### V/Q Mismatch and Etymology

* V/Q mismatch occurs when V/Q â‰  1:
    * **V/Q >1** (Dead Space)\
    Ventilation in excess of perfusion.
        * However, pulmonary blood is passing ventilated alveoli and PaO~2~ is normal <br><br>
    * **V/Q 0 to 1**  (V/Q scatter)\
    Perfusion in excess of ventilation.
        * Increasing in PAO~2~ will increase PaO~2~
        * This is commonly referred to by the general term of V/Q mismatch<br><br>
    * **V/Q = 0** (Shunt)\
    Mixed venous blood entering the systemic circulation without being oxygenated via passage through the lungs. PaO~2~ falls.
