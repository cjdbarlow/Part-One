# Humidifiers


Humidifiers add water vapour to inspired gas, taking the place of normal body mechanisms which are bypassed or impeded by invasive and non-invasive ventilation. Maintaining adequate humidity of inspired gas is important in:

* Reducing metabolic load\
Humidification of inspired gas accounts for ~15% of basal heat expenditure.
* Maintaining function of the mucociliary elevator\
Inspiration of dry gas increases viscosity of mucous.
* Reducing water loss\
Water will be absorbed from mucosa to humidify gas.

Humidifiers can be classified into active or passive.

## Passive Humidifiers

Passive humidifiers:

* Do not require power
* Do not require water

The Heat and Moisture Exchange (HME) filter is the classic passive humidifier:

* Placed between the patient and the patient Y-piece
* Consists of:
    * A moisture exchange layer\
    Pleated, hygroscopically coated foam or paper.
        * Expired gas cools as it passes, condensing onto the foam, with condensation promoted by hygroscopic coating (usually this is NaCl)
        * The latent heat of vapourisation results in a decreased temperature of expired gas\
    * A filter layer\
    Typically a electrostatic or hydrophobic material.
* Expired gas is cooled and dried
* Inspired gas is then heated and humidified
* An HME takes up to 20 minutes to be fully effective, and can achieve a relative humidity up to 70%
* Efficacy depends upon the patient's core temperature and the condition of the airway

### Pros

* Cheap
* Lightweight
* Straightforward
* May contain anti-bacterial filter


### Cons

* May be blocked with vomit and secretions
* Increase airway resistance
* Increase dead space
* Not as effective as powered active systems
* Only last 24 hours
* Takes 15-20 minutes to become fully effective


## Active Humidifiers

Active Humidifiers:

* Require either:
    * Power\
    Unpowered humidifiers are typically less effective, and only operate well at lower flow rates.
    * Water
    * (Or both)
* Consist of:
    * A water bath\
    Typically sterile water.
    * A heating element\
    To heat the water bath.
    * A gas pipe\
    Inspired gases are bubbled through the water bath to humidify them.
    * A water trap\
    To trap condensed water. Should be changed regularly to minimise infection risk.

### Pros

* Greater humidification
* Appropriate for long-term ventilation

### Cons

* Bulky
* Expensive
* Require power
* Infection risk from water bath
