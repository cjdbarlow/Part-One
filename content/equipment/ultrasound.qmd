:::ANZCA
Describe basic physics applicable to anaesthesia in particular principles of ultrasound imaging and use of doppler.

Ultrasound is an imaging technique where high-frequency sound waves (2-15MHz) are used to generate an image.

An ultrasound wave is produced by a probe using the **piezoelectric effect**:

* Certain crystalline structures will vibrate at a particular frequency when a certain voltage is applied across them\
The conversion of electrical energy to kinetic energy is how the ultrasound probe creates an ultrasound wave.
* Similarly, they can generate a voltage when a vibration is induced in them\
This is how the probe interprets reflected waves.


## Basic Terms

* **Spatial resolution**\
How close two separate objects can be to each other and still be distinguishable. It is divided into:
    * **Axial resolution**, how far apart two objects can be when one is above the other (in the direction of the beam)
    * **Lateral resolution**, how far apart two objects can be when side side-by-side
* Contrast resolution is how similar two objects can appear (in echogenic appearance) and still be distinguishable
* **Higher frequency** settings offer greater spatial resolution but decreased penetration
* **Lower frequency** settings offer reduced spatial resolution but increased penetration\
They are used for visualising deep structures.


## Effect of Tissues on Ultrasound

At tissue interfaces, the wave may be:

* **Absorbed**\
Sound is lost as heat, and increases with decreased water content of tissues.
* **Reflected**\
Sound bounces back from the tissue interface, and returns to the probe.
    * Reflection is dependent on the:
        * **Difference in sound conduction** between the two tissues
        * **Angle of incidence** (close to 90Â° improves reflection)
        * **Smoothness** of the tissue plane
    * The amplitude of sound returning to the probe determines echogenicity, or how white the object will be displayed
    * The time taken for the sound to return determines depth
        * The time taken for a wave to return is proportional to **twice** the distance of the object from the probe
        * Depth can be calculated using $d = vt$, where:
            * $d$ is Depth
            * $v$ is the speed of sound in tissue, and is assumed to be 1540 ms^-1^
            * $t$ is Time
* **Transmitted**\
Sound passes through the tissue, and may be reflected or absorbed at deeper tissues.
* **Scattered**\
Sound is reflected from tissue but is not received by the probe.
* **Attenuated**\
Attenuation describes the loss of sound wave with increasing depth, and is a function of the above factors.
    * Attenuation is managed by increasing the **gain**\
    Gain refers to amplification of returned signal.
    * **Time-gain compensation** refers to amplification of signals which have taken longer to return, which amplifies signals returned from deep tissues

A combination of these effects occur; i.e. some ultrasound energy will be absorbed, some portion reflected, and some transmitted further through the tissue, etc.

## Modes

Ultrasound modes include:

* **B-Mode** (brightness mode)\
The standard 2D ultrasound mode, and plots the measured amplitude of reflected ultrasound waves by the calculated depth from which they were reflected. 
* **M-Mode** (movement mode)\
Selects a single vertical section of the image and displays changes over time (i.e. depth on the y-axis, and time on the x-axis).


## Doppler Effect

The doppler effect is the change in observed frequency when a wave is reflected off (or emitted from) a moving object, relative to the position of the receiver. In medical ultrasound, this is the change in frequency of sound reflected from a moving tissue (e.g. an erythrocyte). It is given by the equation:

$V = { \Delta Fs \over 2F_0cos\theta}$, where: 

$V$ = Velocity of object\
$F$ = Frequency shift\
$s$ = Speed of sound (in blood)\
$F_0$ = Frequency of the emitted sound\
$\theta$ = Angle between the sound wave and the object

Reflected frequencies are **higher towards the probe** and **lower away**.


### Calculation of Cardiac Output

* Heart rate is measured
* Stroke volume is calculated by:
    * Measuring the **cross-sectional area** of the **left ventricular outflow tract**\
    Obtained by measuring the diameter using ultrasound.
    * Measuring the **stroke distance**\
    Obtained via integrating the velocity-time waveform for time across the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT VTI).
        * The integral of flow (m.s^-1^ and time (s)) for time (s), produces a distance (m)
    * Multiplying the LVOT cross-sectional area (m^2^) by the stroke distance (m), produces a volume (m^3^)\
    This is the stroke volume.
