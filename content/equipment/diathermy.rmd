# Diathermy


> <p style="color:purple";> Discuss the principles of surgical diathermy, its safe use and the potential hazards</p>

Diathermy is the use of an electrical current to cut tissue and coagulate blood via localised heating. Diathermy:

* Uses **high frequency**, **alternating current** passing between two electrodes\
Frequencies between 300kHz and 2MHz are used, which have a negligible risk of inducing arrhythmia.
* Heat energy produced is proportional to electrical power dissipated ($I^2R$)
* Relies on the principle of current density\
$Current \ Density = {Current \over Area}$
    * A high current density at the electrode causes tissue damage
    * A low current density (e.g. at the plate of a unipolar electrode) causes heating without damage

## Diathermy Types

Diathermy can be either:

* **Unipolar**\
Consists of a probe containing one electrode, and a large plate (placed elsewhere on the patient) containing the other probe.
* **Bipolar**\
Consists of a pair of forceps with each point containing a separate electrode. Minimises the current passing between probes, and is used when using diathermy on electrically sensitive tissues (e.g. brain).

## Diathermy Modes

Diathermy modes include:

* Cutting\
Low-voltage mode producing a high current in the shape of a continuous sine wave.
* Coagulate\
High-voltage mode producing a damped sine wave response.
* Blended\
Mixture of cutting and coagulate on different tissues.

## Risks

* Burns\
From incorrectly applied unipolar plate.
* Electrocution\
May injure patient, staff, or damage equipment and implants.
* Electrical Interference\
May inhibit pacing in certain pacemakers, or trigger ICDs.
* Smoke production\
Respiratory irritant, dissemination of viral particles, and may be carcinogenic.
* Tissue dissemination\
Potential source of metastatic seeding.
