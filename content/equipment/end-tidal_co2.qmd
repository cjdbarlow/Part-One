# End-Tidal Gas Analysis

> Describe the principles of ~~pulse and tissue oximetry, co-oximetry and~~ capnography, including calibration, sources of errors and limitations 

## Principles

Several mechanisms for E~T~CO~2~ measurement exist:

* Infrared Spectroscopy
* Colourimetric Methods
* Rayman Scattering
* Gas Chromatography

## Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared spectroscopy relies on the fact that:

* Gases with two or more different atoms will **absorb infrared radiation**
* **Different gases absorb different wavelengths** to different degrees
* Measuring the absorbed wavelengths and comparing with the **likely composition** of a mixture, a system can be designed using a specific wavelength to measure gas concentrations and avoid interference


End-tidal gas analysis using infrared light is used in the measurement of:

* CO~2~\
Capnography is the continuous measurement and graphical display of the partial pressure of CO~2~ in expired gas. This is the most common method to measure E~T~CO~2~. 
* Anaesthetic agents

## Measurement of CO~2~

Components:

* Sapphire sampling chamber containing gas sample\
    * CO~2~ absorbs infrared radiation at a peak wavelength of 4.28μm
    * The sapphire lens only allows 4.28μm light through
* Emitter
* Detector
* Microprocessor
* Display


Method:

* Light is emitted and passes through the sampling chamber\
A lens is used to focus emitted light.
* Levels of radiation are measured on the other side of the chamber\
* Levels correspond to the amount of gas present in the sample
* The less radiation that reaches the detector, the more gas there is in the sample absorbing it

### Equipment Errors

Errors can be classified into:

* Specific to technique
    * The **collision broadening effect**\
    Intermolecular forces vary depending on their proximity to other molecules in the gas mixture. A change in intermolecular forces may alter their bond-energy and the frequencies at which they absorb radiation. It can be overcome by:
        * Correcting for the presence of other gases
        * Manually adjusting the obtained values
    * Crossover with other gas mixtures\
    CO~2~ and N~2~O have similar absorbance spectra, and may lead to error when a device is not designed to measure both wavelengths.


* Failure of equipment\
These can be overcome by use of **double-beam capnometer**. This uses a reference chamber which contains CO~2~-free air, and the same emitter-detector system. All absorption from this system must occur due to artefact (as no CO~2~ is present). The artefactual component is then subtracted from the value detected in the main chamber. This corrects for:
    * Variable amount of infrared radiation released
    * Variable sensitivity of the detector
    * Variable efficacy of the crystal window and lens system


* Relating to type of capnometer used\
E~T~CO~2~ may be either **side-stream** or **in-line**.
    * Side-stream CO~2~ involves a length of narrow tubing drawing gas from the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit (typically from the HME filter) to the capnograph
        * Side-stream requires a flow of 150 ml.min^-1^\
        * Has a (pretty insignificant) delay (<1s) in measurement
        * May be blocked by water vapour, and require use of a water trap to remove condensation
    * In-line systems have a sampling chamber attached in-line with the ETT
        * The sampling chamber slightly increases the dead-space of the circuit\
        May be relevant in children or very difficult to ventilate patients.
        * Adds weight to patient end of the breathing circuit
        * Require heating to 41°C to avoid condensation


### Normal E~T~CO~2~ Waveform{#capno}

<img src="/resources/capno-normal.svg">

The normal trace consists of four components:
1. The **baseline**\
This consists of:
    * Inspiratory time
    * Early **dead-space exhalation**\
    This is the period immediately before phase 2, where some gas with a PCO~2~ of **0** is exhaled.
2. **Alveolar exhalation**, where PCO~2~ **rises rapidly**
3. **Alveolar plateau**, where PCO~2~ **flattens**\
The highest-point of this curve is labeled E~T~CO~2~.
4. **Inspiration**, where PCO~2~ returns to **0**

### E~T~CO~2~ Waveform Variations{#var}

**Airway obstruction:
**<img src="/resources/capno-obstruction.svg">
* Occurs due to uneven emptying of alveoli with different time-constants

**Hyperventilation:
**<img src="/resources/capno-hyperventilation.svg">
* Lower E~T~CO~2~ with shorter baseline
* Plateau phase may not occur at very high respiratory rates

**Rebreathing**:
<img src="/resources/capno-rebreathing.svg">
* Baseline increases as inspired CO~2~ is measured from gas analyser


### Changes in E~T~CO~2~

Normal E~T~CO~2~ is 32-42 mmHg, whilst normal PaCO~2~ is 35-45 mmHg.

#### High E~T~CO~2~

This may be from:

* Decreased ventilation
    * Decreased RR
    * Decreased V~T~
    * Increased V~D~ and therefore a greater V~D~:V~T~ ratio
* Increased production of CO~2~
    * Increased metabolic rate
        * Sepsis
    * Tourniquet release
    * ROSC following arrest
* Increased inspired 
    * Rebreathing (i.e. equipment/ventilator malfunction)
    * External source of added CO~2~

#### Low E~T~CO~2~

##### Rapid Loss of E~T~CO~2~

* Failure of ventilation
    * Circuit disconnect
    * Airway obstruction
    * Bronchospasm
* Failure of circulation
    * Cardiac arrest
    * Shock

##### Gradual Loss of E~T~CO~2~

* Increased V~A~ (i.e. increased MV)
* Decreased CO~2~ production
    * Hypometabolic state
        * Hypothermia
* Increased V~D~, i.e. V/Q mismatch
    * Increased West Zone I physiology:
        * Hypotension
        * Increased RV Afterload:
            * PE
            * High PEEP
* Sampling error
    * Air entrainment into the sample chamber
    * Inadequate V~T~

### Discrepancy between E~T~CO~2~, PACO~2~, and PaCO~2~

The normal gradient between PaCO~2~ and E~T~CO~2~ is 0-5 mmHg. Healthy and awake individuals should have essentially no (<1ml) alveolar dead space, and so essentially no gradient. This gradient is increased in patients with:

* V/Q mismatch
    * E~T~CO~2~ will underestimate arterial CO~2~ as gas from un-perfused alveoli (with negligible CO~2~) will dilute CO~2~ expired gas

## Colourimetric Methods

Litmus paper which changes colour when exposed to hydrogen ions (produced by CO~2~) can be used to confirm endo-tracheal intubation, though they may generate false-positive results due to gastric pH.
