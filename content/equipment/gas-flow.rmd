# Gas Flow

> Describe the measurement of flow, pressure and volume of gases

Types of Flow:

* Laminar flow\
Fluid moving in a steady manner without turbulence.
* Turbulent flow\
Irregular fluid movement in radial, axial, and circumferential axes.
    * Laminar flow is more efficient than turbulent flow, as it requires a smaller pressure gradient to generate the same flow
    * For two fluids moving at the same speed, the velocity of individual particles in laminar flow will be both higher and lower 
* Transitional flow\
Mixture of laminar and turbulent flow. Flow is typically turbulent in the centre, and laminar at the edges.


Devices used to measure gas flow include:

* Variable-Orifice Flowmeters
* Fixed-Orifice Flowmeters\
Pneumotachograph.
* Hot wire flowmeter


Note orifice based flowmeters rely on the **Hagan-Poiseuille Equation**:\
$Q = {\Delta P r^4 \pi \over 8 \eta l} $
* Viscosity ($\eta$) and length ($l$) are fixed by both devices
* Fixed orifice flowmeters also fix radius ($r$), such that the change in pressure must therefore be proportional to flow:\
$Q= {\Delta P \pi k}$, where $k$is a constant
* Variable orifice flowmeters also fix pressure ($\Delta P$), such that flow can be calculated from the radius:\
$Q= r^4 \pi k$


## Flowmeters

**Constant pressure, variable orifice** flowmeters are found on wall and cylinder gases. They consist of:

* An inverse conical tube (i.e. narrower at the bottom, and wider at the top)
* A needle valve
* A bobbin\
May have a groove which causes the bobbin to spin, confirming it is not stuck.

Method:

* Gas flows from the bottom to the top of the tube
* The bobbin obstructs flow\
Therefore there is a **pressure difference** across it.
    * Remember: $Pressure = {Force \over Area} = {Mass \times Acceleration \over Area}$
    * **At equilibrium**, the pressure exerted by the bobbin on the flow of gas ($P = {Gravity \times Bobbin \ Mass \over Bobbin \ Cross-Sectional \ Area}$) is equal to the pressure exerted by the gas on the bobbin
* As flow is increased, the bobbin is pushed further up the flowmeter due to the increased pressure
* The bobbin will reach a new equilibrium position when the orifice of the flowmeter has become wide enough for the pressure on the bobbin to equal the pressure of gravity

* Flowmeters are calibrated for individual gases as:
    * Laminar (typically low flows) flow is proportional to viscosity
    * Turbulent (typically high flows) flow is proportional to density


### Pros

* Cheap
* No additional power supply required
* Accurate\
Readings may be altered by:
    * Change in temperature affects viscosity and density of gas
    * Change in pressure affects density of gas

### Cons

* Must be vertical
* Bobbins can become stuck

## Pneumotachographs

**Constant orifice, variable pressure** flowmeter. Several different designs exist, and include:

* Fleisch pneumotachograph\
    * Consists of several fine bore parallel tubes placed in the gas circuit\
    Decreased radius and increased resistance reduces gas flow velocity, improving laminar flow.
    * A **differential pressure transducer** is placed at either end of the tubes
    * The pressure drop across the tubing is directly proportional to flow
* Pitot tubes\
    * Consists of two tubes placed into the gas circuit:
        * One faces into the gas flow\
        * The other faces away from the gas flow
    * The pressure difference between tubes is proportional to flow

### Pros

* Accurate
* Continual measurement
* Allow calculation of volumes\
$Volume \ (L) = Flow \ (L.s^{-1}) \times Time \ (s)$

### Cons

* Increased resistance
* Increased dead space
* Require laminar flow\
Inaccurate when:
    * Flows are higher than what the system is designed for
    * Alteration in gas density
        * Change in gas mixture
    * Alteration in gas temperature

## Hot Wire Flowmeter

Components:

* Two fine platinum wires in the gas circuit\
    * One heated to 180°C at OL.min^-1^
    * One at 0°C
* Ammeter

Method:

* As gas flows, the wire cools
* Rate of heat dissipation is proportional to gas flow
* The amount of current required to return the wire to 180 is measured, and is proportional to flow

### Pros

* Accurate
* Fast

### Cons

* Fragile
