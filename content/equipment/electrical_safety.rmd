# Electrical Safety


> Understand the concepts of patient safety as it applies to monitoring involving electrical devices

## Electrical Principles

* **Charge** is the property of a subatomic particle which causes it to experience a force when close to other charged particles\
Charge is measured in coulombs (C).

* **Current** is the flow of electrons through a conductor\
Current is measured in amps (A).

* **Voltage** is the strength of the force that causes movement of electrons\
By tradition, voltages are quoted relative to **ground** (or **earth**). If a potential difference exists, a current will flow from that object to the earth via the path of least resistance. If this path contains a person, an electrical injury may result.


* **Resistance** describes to what extent a substance reduces the flow of electrons through it\
Resistance is measured in ohms (Î©).
    * Substances with **high resistance** are **insulators**
    * Substances with **low resistance** are **conductors**


* **Inductance** is the property of a conductor by which a change in current induces an electromotive force in the conductor, and any nearby conductors


* **Capacitance** is the ability of an object to store electrical charge\
Measured in Farads (F), where one farad is when one volt across the capacitor stores one coulomb of charge.
    * A capacitor is an electrical component consisting of two conductors separated by an insulator (called a dielectric)
    * When a **direct current** flows, electrons (a negative charge) build up on one of these conductors (called a plate), whilst an electron deficit (positive charge) occurs on the other plate
        * Current will flow until the build up of charge is equal to the voltage of the power source
        * Current can be **rapidly discharged** when the circuit is changed
    * An **alternating current** can flow freely across a capacitor, and causes no buildup of charge
  \
  \
* **Impedance** describes to what extent the flow of **alternating current** is reduced when passing through a substance\
Impedance can be thought of as 'resistance for AC circuits', and is a combination of **resistance **and **reactance**.
    * Reactance is a function of two things:
        * Induction of voltage in conductors by the alternating magnetic field of AC flow
        * Capacitance induced by voltages between these conductors


## Electrical Injury

Potential electrical injuries can be divided into:

* **Ventricular Fibrillation**\
Likelihood is a function of:
    * Current density
    * Frequency\
    Lowest current density required is at **50Hz**.


* **Burns**\
Function of current density. Burns typically occur at the entry and exit point as this is where current density is highest.

* **Tetanic Contraction**\
Flexors are stronger than extensors, which may maintain grip on live wire. Death may result from either VF or asphyxiation from sustained respiratory muscle contraction.


### Electrical Shock

Electrical shocks are divided into two types, based on their ability to induce VF:

* **Microshock**\
Current required to induce VF when applied directly to myocardium.
    * Typical current is **0.05-0.1mA**
    * This requires **skin breach**\
    Potential causes:
        * Guidewire
        * Pacing lead
        * Column of conducting fluid
        * CVC
        * PICC
* **Macroshock**\
Current required to induce VF from surface contact.
    * Typical current is **100mA**
    * This is much higher because most of this current is not going to the ventricle, and so the total current must be greater to achieve sufficient **current density** in the myocardium to induce VF

Other detrimental effects seen at lower currents include:

|Current (mA)|Effect|
|--|--|
|1|Tingling|
|5|Pain|
|8|Burns|
|15|Skeletal muscle tetany|
|50|Skeletal muscle paralysis & respiratory arrest|


## Principles of Electrical Safety

Power points contain three wires:

* Active\
240V. Measuring voltage for AC current is not intuitive, as the voltage will be negative half the time. The **root mean square** (RMS) is used instead - each value for the voltage is squared (giving a positive number), and then divided by the number of samples to give an average.
* Neutral\
0V, relative to ground.
* Earth\
Direct pathway into ground.

An electrical circuit is completed between an appliance and the power station by returning current to the station via the earth. This is an **earth referenced power supply**.

### Electrical Dangers

* Active wire shorts to equipment casing
    * Principle of earth wire, which provides path of least resistance for current to travel if an individual touches the case
* High current drain through a wire generates heat and starts a fire\
    * Principle of fuses which trigger when current drain is >15A

## Methods of Electrical Safety

* **Insulation**\
Conductors are coated by a high-resistance substance, preventing current flowing where it shouldn't.


* **Fuses**\
Safety devices which cease all current flow when current exceeds a certain threshold (typically 20A). If there is a fault which greatly lowers resistance (i.e. insulation breaks, causing a device to become live and drain via the earth wire), a high current will flow and the fuse will be triggered.
    * A fault requires:
        * A fault that causes a high current flow
        * The fuse to work correctly
  \

* **Residual Current Devices**\
An RCD measures the current difference between the active and neutral lines.
    * In an non-fault situation, these will be equal
    * In a fault situation, current will be being delivered by the active line but not returned via the neutral\
    Current will instead flow to ground via faulty equipment/through the patient.
        * The RCD will detect if there is a >10mA difference between the active and neutral lines, and disconnect power within 10ms if it does so
    * A fault requires:
        * Current to flow
        * A single fault will turn off the circuit      \
    * Pros: Safe
    * Cons: Will shut off power to the device, which is bad for ECMO/CPB/ventilators without battery backup


* **Line Isolation Supply**, with a **line isolation monitor**\
A line isolated supply is a 'transformer' with an equal number of windings, such that the voltage produced is the same on each side. However, the **powerpoint is not physically connected to the supply**, creating an **earth-referenced floating supply**. 
    * A fault requires:
        * **Two** faults\
        This makes a failure with potential for shock much less likely.
            * Active wire must be connected to ground
            * Neutral wire must be connected to ground\
            * A circuit then exists: active wire - ground - neutral wire, and a current could flow
    * A line isolated supply is paired with a line isolation monitor\
    This monitor states how much current *could* flow, *if* a second fault completed the circuit.
        * This is called a **prospective hazard current**
        * The line isolation monitor continuously checks the hazard current by evaluating the impedance between the active wire and ground, and the neutral wire and ground
            * In a no-fault situation, both impedances should be the same and close to infinite\
            (Impedance won't be absolutely infinite as there will always be a small current leak from devices).
            * In a single-fault situation, the calculated impedance for the affected line will be significantly lower, and therefore the prospective hazard current will increase
                * An alarm will sound when the prospective hazard current exceeds 20mA
    * Pros: A single fault is not dangerous and will not result in a power loss (important for vital equipment)
    * Cons: Two or more faults are dangerous, and will still not result in a power loss


* **Equipotential earthing**\
This is the **only method which prevents microshock**.
    * Ultra-low resistance earth cables are attached to electrical devices and the patients bed
    * These cables are then attached to special wall earth connectors
    * This ensures all equipment is referenced to a common ground, minimising the risk of leakage currents between devices and the patient

### Classification of Electrically Safe Equipment

These classifications are designed to limit macroshock:

* **Class I: Earthed**\
Any part that can contact the user is earthed to ground.
    * If a fault develops such that parts of the device that the user can touch are live, then there is a risk of shock
    * If the case is earthed, the path of least resistance should be via the earth wire\
    This will cause a large current to flow, and should blow a fuse, ceasing current flow.

* **Class II: Double-insulated**\
All parts of the device that the user can touch have two layers of insulation around them, reducing the chance of the device becoming live.

* **Class III: Low-voltage**\
Device operates at less than 40V DC/24V AC, limiting the severity of shock a device can deliver.


### Classification of Electrically Safe Areas

* **B areas**: Protection against macroshock
    * Residual Current Devices
    * Line Isolation Supply


* **BF areas**: Cardiac (microshock) protection
    * Equipotential Earthing\
    All devices, and the patient, are earthed to each other by thick copper (i.e. low-resistance), such that any potential difference between devices will be equalised via the path of least resistance (the wire, not the patient).


* **Z areas**: No particular protections

### Electrical Devices which Attach to Patients

Devices such as ECG and BIS require an electrical connection to the patient. Risk of electrocution by these devices is reduced by:

* High resistance wires
