# Wheatstone Bridge

The Wheatstone bridge is an electrical device used to accurately measure very small changes in electrical resistance.

The Wheatstone bridge is:

* Historically used in many other medical devices (e.g. invasive pressure monitoring)
* A device with **infinite gain**
* A **null deflection galvanometer** 
* **Not an amplifier**\
As it does not increase current amplitude.

## Mechanism

The Wheatstone bridge consists of:

* Battery
* Four resistors
    * $R_1$ and $R_3$ are **known** and **fixed**
    * $R_2$ is **known** and **adjustable**
    * $R_4$ is **unknown**
* Galvanometer

The Wheatstone bridge relies on the ratio of resistances between the known ($R_2 \over R_1$) and unknown ($R_4 \over R_3$) legs:

* When ${R_2 \over R_1} = {R_4 \over R_3}$, equal current flows down either limb and there is **no current flow** across the galvanometer\
At this point the bridge is said to be balanced.
    * The equation can then be re-arranged to solve for $R_4$:\
     $R_4 = {R_2 \over R_1}.R_3$
* Very small changes in $R_4$ lead to a current flow across the bridge
* $R_2$ is then be adjusted until the bridge is balanced; at which point the value of $R_4$ is determined
