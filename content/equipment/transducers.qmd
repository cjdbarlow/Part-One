A **transducer** converts one form of energy to another. Pressure transducers converts a pressure signal to an electrical signal, and require:

* Several components
    * Catheter
    * Tubing
    * Stopcock
    * Flush
    * Transducer
* Calibration\
Required in order to read accurately. Two forms of calibration are performed:
    * Static calibration
    * Dynamic calibration

:::column-margin
Pressure exerted by a static fluid is due to the **weight** of the fluid, and is a function of:

* Fluid **density** (in kg.L^-1^)
* **Acceleration** (effect of gravity, in m.s^-2^)
* The **height** of the fluid column

Note that this does not require the mass or the volume of liquid to be known, and is why pressure is often measured in height-substance units (e.g. mmHg, cmH~2~O), as acceleration is assumed to be constant.
\
\
This relationship can be demonstrated as follows. First, axioms:
\
\
$\begin{align}
Pressure &= {Force \over Area} \\
&= {Mass \times Acceleration \over Area}
\\
\\
Density &= {Mass \over Volume}, \ therefore: \\
Mass &= Volume \times Density
\end{align}$
\
\
Therefore, by combining the above equations:

$\begin{align}
Pressure &= {Density \times Volume \times Acceleration \over Area} \\
&= Density \times Length \times Acceleration
\end{align}$

## Static Calibration

Static calibration calibrates to a known zero, and involves:

* Leveling the transducer (typically to the level of the phlebostatic axis at the right atrium, or the external auditory meatus)\
A change in transducer level will change the blood pressure due to the change in hydrostatic pressure (in cmH~2~O).
* **Zeroing** the transducer
    * Opening the transducer to air
    * Zeroing the transducer on the monitor\
    A change in measured pressure when the transducer is open to air is due to **drift**, an artifactual measurement error due to damage to the cable, transducer, or monitor.


## Dynamic Calibration

Dynamic calibration ensures the operating characteristics of the system (or **dynamic response**) are accurate. Dynamic response is a function of:

* **Damping**\
How rapidly an oscillating system will come to rest.
    * Damping is quantified by the **damping coefficient** or **damping ratio**
        * Describes to what extent the magnitude of an oscillation falls with each successive oscillation
        * Calculated from the ratio of the amplitudes of successive oscillations in a convoluted fashion:\
        $D = \sqrt{(\ln{D_2 \over D_1})^2 \over \pi^2 + (\ln{D_2 \over D_1})^2 }$, where:\
* **Resonant Frequency**\
How rapidly a system will oscillate when disturbed and left alone.
  * When damping is low, it will be close to the **natural frequency** (or undamped resonant frequency)

:::column-margin
The natural frequency is the frequency that a system oscillates at when disturbed and then left alone.
:::

:::column-margin
Damping and natural frequency of a system are determined by the systems elasticity, mass, and friction, but it is conceptually and mathematically easier to use damping and resonance, as they are both **easily measured** and **accurate** in describing the observed dynamic response.

### Resonance

Resonance describes the progressive amplification of small oscillations or disturbances that occurs when the natural frequency *of* the system or its components aligns with the frequency of pressure fluctuations *within* the system. Resonance:

* Occurs if high frequency components of the pressure waveform approach the natural frequency of the system
* Results in a distorted output signal and an **overshoot in systolic pressure**


### Damping

A pressure transduction system should be adequately damped:

<img src="/resources/damping2.svg">

* An **optimally** damped waveform has a damping of **0.64**. It demonstrates:
    * A rapid return to baseline following a **step-change**, with **one overshoot and one undershoot**
    * Accuracy over a wide range of frequency responses
* A **critically damped** waveform has a damping coefficient of **1**. It demonstrates:
    * The most rapid return to baseline possible following a step-change **without overshooting**
* An **over-damped** waveform has a damping coefficient of **>1**. It demonstrates:
    * A slow return to baseline following a step-change  with no oscillations
    * Slurred upstroke
    * Absent dicrotic notch
* Loss of fine detail
* An **under-damped** waveform has a damping coefficient close to 0 (e.g. **0.03**). It demonstrates:
    * A very rapid return to baseline following a step-change  with several oscillations
    * Systolic pressure overshoot
    * Artifactual bumps

## Dynamic Response

Dynamic response refers to how accurately the transducer can track and respond to changes in pressure over time, without distorting the signal. The dynamic response:

* Necessary to faithfully reproduce a signal is dependent on the nature of the pressure wave to be measured
* Must be greater to accurately reproduce an arterial waveform compared to a venous waveform


### Principles of Waveform Analysis

An arterial pressure waveform is a periodic (repeating) complex wave. With respect to complex waves:

* Complex waveforms can be represented mathematically by **Fourier analysis**
* Fourier analysis involves expressing a complex waves as the sum of many simple sine waves of varying frequencies and amplitudes
* The frequency of the arterial wave (i.e., the pulse rate) is known as the **fundamental frequency**
* The sine waves used to reproduce it must have a frequency that is a *multiple* (or **harmonic**) of the fundamental frequency
    * Increasing the number of harmonics allows better reproduction of high-frequency components, such as a steep systolic upstroke
* Accurate reproduction of an **arterial** waveform requires up to **10 harmonics** - or **10 times the pulse rate**
* An arterial pressure transducer should therefore have a dynamic response of **30Hz**
    * This allows accurate reproduction of blood pressure in heart rates up to 180bpm (180 bpm = 3Hz, 3Hz x 10 = 30Hz)


### Testing Dynamic Response

Dynamic response can be tested by inducing a **step-change** in the system, which allows calculation of both the natural frequency and the damping coefficient. Clinically, this is performed by doing a **fast-flush test**.

* Fast flush valve is opened during diastolic runoff period (minimises systemic interference)
* The pressure wave produced indicates the natural frequency and damping coefficient of the system:
  * The **distance between** successive oscillations should be identical and equal to the natural frequency of the system
  * The **ratio of amplitudes** of successive oscillations gives the damping coefficient

### Optimising Dynamic Response

The lower the natural frequency of a monitoring system, the smaller the range of damping coefficients which can accurately reproduce a measured pressure wave. Therefore, the optimal dynamic response is seen when the natural frequency is as **high as possible**. This is achieved when the tubing is:

* Short
* Wide
* Stiff
* Free of air\
Introducing an air bubble will increase damping (generally good, since most systems are under-damped), however it will lower the natural frequency and is detrimental overall.
