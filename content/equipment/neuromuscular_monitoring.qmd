The degree of neuromuscular blockade achieved using neuromuscular blocking drugs can be assessed:

* **Clinically**\
Crude compared to electrical assessment. Described methods include:
    * Sustained head lift >5 seconds\
    Suggests <30% blockade.
    * V~T~ >10ml.kg^-1^
    * Tongue protrusion
* **Electrically**\
Using a nerve stimulator. Can be:
    * Visual/tactile\
    Monitoring of twitch height by anaesthetist. Inaccurate.
    * Electrical\
    Monitoring of twitch height by a device:
        * Accelerometer\
        Acceleration is proportional to force for any given mass ($F = ma$), therefore an accelerometer taped to the thumb can be used to assess force of contraction.
        * Mechanical force transducers\
        Muscle tension is measured using a strain gauge. Requires calibrating prior to drug administration.
        * Electromyography\
        EMG response is measured using electrodes over the muscle. The AUC of the response curve can be used to calculate degree of blockade.

## Nerve Stimulator

Depth of neuromuscular blockade can be assessed using a **nerve stimulator**, which:

* Consists of two electrodes, a power supply, and a controller
* Produces a monophasic, **square wave** at **constant current**, lasting no more than **0.3ms**
* Generates a **supra-maximal stimulus**\
Ensures every nerve fibre is depolarised, which means a consistently reproducible response will be generated. A supra-maximal stimulus is 25% greater than the maximum required to depolarise all nerve fibres.
* Allows assessment of different muscle groups\
Not all muscle groups are affected equally by neuromuscular blockade.
    * Typically **smaller muscle** groups are **more sensitive**
    * The **positive** (red) lead is placed **proximally**
    * Ulnar nerve\
    Electrodes are placed along the ulnar border of the wrist at the flexor crease, and thumb adduction is assessed.
    * Facial nerve\
    The positive electrode is placed at the outer canthus, and the negative electrode is placed anterior to the tragus. Eyebrow twitching is assessed.
    * Posterior tibial nerve\
    Electrodes are placed posterior to the medial malleolus, and plantar flexion is assessed.


### Stimulation Patterns

There are five common stimulation patterns:

* **Train of Four**\
Four single twitches (0.1ms) delivered at 2Hz (i.e. 1.5s for all 4).
    * Number of observed twitches gives an indication of receptor occupancy\
    With increasing blockade, the amplitude and number of observed twitches decreases.
        * **Fade** is the reduction of twitch height with repeated stimuli during a partial neuromuscular block\
        Occurs due to the effect of non-depolarising agents on the *pre*synaptic membrane, reducing ACh production.
        * Number of observed twitches depends on the degree of blockade:
            * No twitches ≈ 100% blockade
            * One twitch ≈ 90% blockade
            * Two twitches ≈ 80% blockade
            * Three twitches ≈ 75% blockade\
            Reversal agents should not be given with a ToF count < 3.
            * Four twitches ≈ < 75% blockade
    * The ratio of the amplitude of T~1~ to T~4~ (ToF ratio) can also be used as a measure of blockade:
        * ToF ratio > 90% is adequate for extubation
        * ToF ratio > 70% suggests adequate respiratory function
    * Should not be repeated faster than every 10s
* **Tetanic stimulation**\
High frequency (50-200Hz) supramaximal stimulus for 5 seconds.
    * Normal muscle will exhibit tetanic contraction
    * Partially paralysed muscle exhibits fade\
    Degree of fade is proportional to degree of blockade, and is very sensitive.
* **Post-tetanic count** (PTC)\
Used in deep blockade when there is no response to ToF. A tetanic stimulus is given, followed 3s later by single twitches at 1Hz.
    * No response may be seen in very deep blockade
    * However, twitches may be seen prior to the return of a ToF response.\
    This is called **post-tetanic facilitation**, and occurs due to the tetanic stimulus mobilising ACh vesicles into the pre-junctional area.
        * Typically, a ToF of 1 will occur when the PTC ≈ 9
    * Should not be repeated faster than every 6 minutes\
    Due to residual post-tetanic potentiation.
* **Double burst**\
Two 0.2ms 50Hz (tetanic) stimuli are applied 750ms apart.
    * Two identical contractions occur in normal muscle
    * Amplitude of the second burst is reduced in partially paralysed muscle\
    DB ratio is similar to the ToF ratio, but is easier to assess clinically.
    * A ratio > 0.9 is required for adequate reversal
* **Single twitch**\
A single stimulus lasting ~0.2ms is applied.
    * \> 75% blockade causes a depressed response
    * A twitch must be assessed prior to blockade so a baseline can be established
