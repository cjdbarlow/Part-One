# Part One

Part One is a reference for trainees preparing for the CICM and ANZCA Primary Exams.

* Part One **is**:
    * Designed to cover the ***assessed*** sections of the CICM and ANZCA curricula **in enough detail to pass**
    * A rough guide for the expected depth of knowledge required on a topic
    * A tool to correct your written answers
    * A source of information you might find difficult to find elsewhere
* Part One **is not**:
    * A textbook
    * The definitive guide to the primary exam\
    * A complete reference\
    There will be both omissions and errors. If you find any, please <a href="mailto:jake@jakebarlow.me?Subject=Part%20One" target="_top">let me know</a>.

## Layout
The book is divided into three sections:

* **Curriculum**\
Covers statistics, physiology, equipment and measurement, and anatomy.
    * Pages are laid out using the section title, topic titles, and order from the CICM curriculum
    * When a topic is only examinable in the ANZCA curriculum, it has been slotted in somewhere sensible
    * Topics covered by the page are listed at the beginning of each page

::: dual

* **Pharmacopoeia**\

* **Appendices**
Includes the key definitions, graphs, and equations you should know, as well as sample structures for SAQs.

High quality model answers to the ANZCA primary.
