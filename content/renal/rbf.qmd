# Functional Anatomy and Control of Renal Blood Flow

:::CICM
Describe the functional anatomy of the kidneys and renal blood flow.

## Functional Anatomy

The functional unit of the kidney is the **nephron**. Nephrons:

* Are composed of the glomerulus, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct
* Are divided by their location into:
    * **Superficial cortical** nephrons\
    Have **short loops** of Henle.
    * **Juxtamedullary** nephrons\
    Have **long loops** of Henle, and the efferent arteriole forms the vasa recta for the kidney.
    * **Mid-cortical nephrons**\
    May have either long or short loops.

## Control of Renal Blood flow

The kidneys:

* Receive **22% of cardiac output** at rest
* Extract only **10% of delivered O~2~**
* Have a **high renal blood flow** exceeds that required for metabolism\
High flow is instead needed **to produce** the large volume of **glomerular filtrate** (125ml.min^-1^) required for excretion of waste.

### Autoregulation

Renal blood flow is **autoregulated** over a wide range of mean arterial pressures (60-160mmHg) via:

* **Myogenic** autoregulation
* **Tubuloglomerular** feedback

**Myogenic** autoregulation:

* Describes the intrinsic constriction of the afferent arteriole in response to an increased transmural pressure
* This increases vascular resistance in proportion to the increase in pressure, keeping flow constant

**Tubuloglomerular feedback** is more complicated, and describes the constriction or dilation of the afferent arteriole in response to adenosine or NO (respectively) release from the macula densa:

* The macula densa lies in the wall of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle
* It detects change in tubular flow rate (probably via changing Na^+^ flux across its membrane)
    * Increased flow in the loop indicates an increased perfusion pressure, prompting release of adenosine and constriction of the afferent arteriole
    * Decreased flow indicates a decreased perfusion pressure, reducing adenosine release and prompting the release of NO and renin, which causes the afferent arteriole to dilate


Notably, flow to **juxtamedullary** nephrons is **not autoregulated**. High blood pressure  increases juxtamedullary flow, increasing GFR and impairing renal concentration, resulting in a **pressure diuresis**.

### Neuronal Control

The kidneys are innervated by noradrenergic sympathetic nerves, which causes:

* Afferent and efferent arteriolar constriction\
This increases capillary hydrostatic pressure (increasing filtration) and also increases capillary oncotic pressure (decreasing filtration).
    * This leads to an overall slight reduction in GFR

### Hormonal Control

**Renin**^[The actions of the RAAS are described in more detail in the [endocrine functions of the kidney](endocrine_functions_of_the_kidney.md#raas).]:

* Is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus by Î²~1~ stimulation
* Catalyses the production of angiotensin I from circulating angiotensinogen\
Angiotensin I is then converted into Angiotensin II by circulating ACE.
