# Structures for SAQs

Structured answers are vital:

* Structure aids both learning and recall of information
* A structured format is easy to follow less likely to irritate the drunk/tired/hungover mind of the examiner
* You may get marks for incomplete answers if your structure demonstrates you have an understanding of the topic, even if the details are not filled in

Some questions lend themselves more easily to a particular structure than others, but all questions can be made to fit even a basic structure.

## Regulation of Physiological Responses

* Sensor
* Integration
* Effector

## Change in Level of a Substance

* Intake
* Distribution
* Elimination

## Compare and Contrast (Drugs)

* **C**lass
* **P**harmaceutics
    * Uses
    * Chemical
    * Presentation
    * Heat/light stability
    * Routes of administration
    * Doses
* **P**harmacokinetics
    * **A**bsorption
    * **D**istribution
    * **M**etabolism
    * **E**limination
* **P**harmacodynamics
    * Main Action
    * Mode of Action
    * Effects (See the physiological approach)
    * Side Effects
    * Toxic effects
        * Allergic
        * Dose-dependent
        * Idiopathic
        * Drug interactions

## Describe Why Two Drugs are Used in Combination

* Definition\
Brief, of each drug.
    * Consider the components of anaesthesia that each provides
* Pharmacokinetics
    * Interactions
    * Relative onset
    * Metabolism
        * No effect/Induces/Inhibits
    * Elimination
* Pharmacodynamics
    * Isobologram\
    Synergistic/additive/antagonistic.
    * Then list the effects of each drug, and how they are modified by the other
        * e.g. if drugs are synergistic, then decreased doses will be required
            * Increases beneficial effects
            * Decreases adverse effects
