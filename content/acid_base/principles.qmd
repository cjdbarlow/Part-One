# Principles of Acid-Base Physiology

Explain the principles underlying acid-base chemistry
:::

There have been several different theories of acid-base chemistry. The one most relevant for the primary exam is the **Brønsted–Lowry definition**, which defines:

* An **acid** as a **proton donor**
* A **base** as a **proton acceptor**

## pH

* Stands for the **power of hydrogen**
* Is a measure of **hydrogen ion activity** in a solution
* Activity can be approximated by concentration
    * Therefore, pH can be expressed as a function of hydrogen ion concentration:  $pH = -log_{10}[H^+]$\
    Using pH rather than concentration makes it easier to compare different solutions.

## pKa

* Strong acids (and bases) dissociate completely in solution
* Weak acids (and bases) only partially dissociate\
They have a dissociated state (A-) and an undissociated state (HA)
* The ratio of concentrations on each side can be used to calculate the **acid dissociation constant**, **Ka**\
$Ka = {[A^-] \times [H^+] \over [HA]}$\
This equation describes the strength of an acid by indicating how readily the acid gives up its hydrogen.
* Similar to pH, this value is often log transformed to **pKa** produce an index, which allows easy comparison of different substances:\
$pKa = -log_{10}Ka$\
* pKa has several useful properties:
    * An acid of base will be 50% ionised when the pH of its solution equals its pKa
    * **A**cids are more **i**onised **a**bove their pKa^[Acids:\

    * **B**ases are more **i**onised **b**elow their pKa^[Bases:\

    * An increase in pH of 1 above the pKa will result in that substance being either 90% (for an acid) or 10 % (for a base) ionised
 
## Systemic Effects of Acid-Base Disorders

pH disturbance affects many organ systems:

* **Respiratory**
    * Increased $\dot{V}_A$\
    Peripheral and central chemoreceptors increase ventilation in response to a fall in pH.
    * Oxyhaemoglobin-Dissociation Curve\
    Right-shifted by a fall in pH.
    * Bronchoconstriction\
    Hypercapnea causes parasympathetically-mediated bronchoconstriction.
* **Cardiovascular**
    * Inotropy\
    Inotropy falls in acidosis due to a direct myocardial depressant effect. May be offset by increased SNS tone in low-grade acidosis. Alkalosis may increase inotropy by increasing responsiveness to circulating catecholamines.
    * Decreased response to catecholamines\
    When pH < 7.2.
    * Arrhythmias\
    Secondary to altered SNS tone and electrolytes.
    * Vasodilation\
    Directly due to hypercapnea.
* **CNS**\
H^+^ ions cannot cross the BBB, however CO~2~ can.
* **Fluid and Electrolyte**\
    * Plasma **K^+^ increases **by** 0.6mmol.L^-1^ for every 0.1 unit fall** in **pH**\
    This is due to impairment of the Na^+^/K^+^-ATPase
    * **H^+^ ions bind **to the **same site on albumin as calcium**, so ionised calcium will **increase**
* **MSK**
    * Bones\
    Chronic metabolic acidosis consumes bone phosphate to buffer H^+^ ions, causing osteoporosis.
* **Cellular**
    * Enzyme function\
    Denaturation and functional impairment.
    * Molecular ionisation\
    Change in ionisation may change a molecules ability to cross cell membranes (e.g. reducing dose of thiopentone in acidosis), or affect their function
    * Resting membrane potential\
    Change in ion permeability will alter RMP, and therefore how easy it is to generate an action potential.
 
### Change with Temperature

pH is temperature dependent:

* **pH increases** by **0.015** for every **1°C fall** in **temperature**\
Due to decreased ionic dissociation of water.
* **Gas solubility **almost always** increases** when **temperature falls**\
Dissolving is typically (not always) an **exothermic** reaction. As the kinetic energy content of a molecule falls, its ability to dissociate from solution decreases.
    * As CO~2~ dissolves, PaCO~2~ falls
* As blood gas machines operate at 37°C, a measurement error will occur if a patient is  not close to 37°C
    * A **hypothermic** patient will have a **higher pH** and **CO~2~** than measured

There are two common methods for **managing** pH of significantly hypothermic patients (e.g., those on CPB): **pH-stat** and **alpha-stat**.

#### pH-stat

* CO~2~ is added to the circuit so that pH and PaCO~2~ are normal when corrected for temperature
* This theoretically improves oxygen delivery by preventing the left-shift in the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve
* The increased CO~2~ also causes cerebral vasodilation, which:
    * Increases speed and uniformity of cerebral cooling
    * Increases risk of cerebral embolic events

#### alpha-stat

* pH and CO~2~ values are maintained at 'normal for 37°C'
    * Measured values will be different, as:
        * pH will be increased
        * CO~2~ will be decreased
* Cellular autoregulation is preserved
* Unlike pH-stat, this does not cause cerebral vasodilation
