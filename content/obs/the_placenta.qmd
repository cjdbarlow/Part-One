# The Placenta

> Outline the functions of the placenta, and determinants of placental blood flow.

The placenta is an organ of maternal and foetal origin which supports the developing foetus.

## Physiological Properties

The placenta has three broad functions:

* Interface between foetus and mother for nutrient exchange
* Immunological barrier
* Endocrine

### Nutrient and Waste Exchange Functions

The primary purpose of the placenta is **diffusion of nutrients and oxygen**, and **removal of waste**.

As with the lung, diffusion is dependent on Fick's Principle, i.e.:

$\dot{V} = {A \times D \times \Delta P \over T }$, where:\
* $\dot{V}$= Flow of substance across the membrane
* $A$= Area of the membrane
* $D$= Diffusion constant for the substance, where $D \propto {Lipid \ Solubility \over \sqrt{Molecular \ Weight}} $
  * Molecules < 600 Da in size more readily diffuse down concentration gradients
* $\Delta P$= Concentration difference across the membrane\
    * Maternal placental flow is ~600mL.min^-1^ at term - double that of foetal flow - which improves diffusion by increasing the concentration gradient for solutes
* $T$= Thickness of the membrane


#### O~2~ Diffusion{#bohr}

At the end of pregnancy, **PO~2~ for foetal blood**:

* Entering the placenta via the umbilical artery is **18mmHg** (SpO2 45%)\
* Leaving the placenta via umbilical vein is **28mmHg** (SpO2 70%)

The foetus is able to have adequate delivery of O~2~ despite the low PO~2~ for four reasons:

* **High Cardiac Index**\
Increased cardiac output increases DO~2~.

* **Foetal Hb**\
Contains **two gamma subunits** instead of beta subunits. These prevent the binding of 2,3-DPG, which result in a **left-shifted Oxy-Haemoglobin dissociation curve**, favouring oxygen loading at a low PaO~2~.

* Foetal [Hb] is 50% greater than maternal [Hb]
 

* The **Double Bohr** effect:\
The Bohr effect states that an **increase** in **PaCO~2~** **right-shifts** the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve. Conversely, the affinity of Hb for O~2~ increases in alkalaemia. The double Bohr effect describes this happening in opposite directions in the foetal and maternal circulations, favouring transfer of O~2~ to the foetus:
    * In the placenta, foetal CO~2~ diffuses into maternal blood down its concentration gradient\
    This makes **foetal blood relatively alkaline, and maternal blood relatively acidic**. Therefore:
      * O~2~ unloading of maternal blood is favoured
      * O~2~ loading of foetal blood is favoured

#### CO~2~ Diffusion

CO~2~ is extremely lipid soluble, and so passes easily across membranes. Foetal PaCO~2~ is ~50mmHg, and intervillous PCO~2~ is ~37mmHg. CO~2~ offloading is favoured in the foetus by:

* A high Foetal [Hb] increases the amount of CO~2~ that can be carried as carbaminohaemoglobin
* The **Double Haldane** effect:\
The Haldane effect states that deoxygenated Hb binds CO~2~ with more affinity than oxygenated Hb. The double Haldane effect describes this happening in opposite directions in the maternal and foetal circulations, favouring CO~2~ transfer to the mother:
    * As maternal blood releases O~2~, this favours maternal loading of CO~2~ without an increase in maternal PCO~2~ (Haldane effect)
    * The release of CO~2~ from the foetal Hb favours O~2~ loading, which in turn favours further maternal O~2~ release.

#### Nutrient Diffusion

In late pregnancy, foetal caloric requirements are high (approximately the same as the mother). **Facilitated diffusion** of **glucose** via carrier molecules occurs in trophoblasts.

Active transport occurs for amino acids, Ca^2+^, Fe, folate, and vitamins A and C. Other transporters actively remove substances from foetal circulation.

### Immunological Function

The placenta is selectively **permeable to IgG** via pinocytosis, which allows maternal antibodies to provide passive immunity to the foetus.


### Endocrine Function

Synthesises:
- βHCG
- hPL
- Oestriol
- Progesterone

## Development

The placenta develops simultaneously from foetus and mother:

* From the uterine wall, the mother produces **blood sinuses** around the trophoblastic cords
  * These  in turn send out **placental villi**
* This creates a sinus of maternal blood invaginated by multiple foetal villi

* Foetal villi are supplied by **two umbilical arteries** and a **single umbilical vein**
* Maternal sinuses are filled from the **uterine arteries**
* The maternal sinuses are supplied by **spiral arteries**

## Properties of the Developing Placenta

* Thick(er) membrane impairs permeability\
  Placental membrane permeability is small in early-to-mid pregnancy, reaching maximum at ~34 weeks
* Smaller surface area

## Properties of the Mature Placenta

* Thick membrane - improved permeability
* Surface area of 14m^2^
* Weight of ~500g
* Blood flow of 600mL.min^-1^ at term\
  Flow is reduced during contractions due to increased uterine pressure and also with α-adrenergic stimulation.
