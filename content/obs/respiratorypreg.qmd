# Respiratory Changes of Pregnancy

> Explain the physiological changes during pregnancy, and parturition

Respiratory changes in pregnancy are a function of two things:

* Anatomical compression of the chest
* Increased VO~2~ and VCO~2~

## Anatomical Changes

* Diaphragm pushed upwards by ~**4cm**
* Increased AP and transverse diameter of the chest wall (~2-3cm)
* Large airway dilation, reducing airway resistance by ~35%

## Volumes and Capacities

From conception until term:

* V~T~ increases by 40%
* Inspiratory capacity increases by 10%
* Expiratory capacity decreases by 30%
* Total lung capacity decreases by 5%
* Vital capacity is unchanged
 
From ~20 weeks until term:

* ERV decreases
* RV decreases
* FRC decreases
    * By 20% erect
    * By 30% supine

## Ventilation

**Progesterone** stimulates respiratory centres, shifting the O~2~ and CO~2~ response curves to the left which causes hyperventilation and a **respiratory alkalosis**. From conception until term:

* MV increases by 50%
    * 10% increase in RR
    * 40% increase in V~T~
* PCO~2~ falls to ~26-32mmHg, with a compensatory drop in plasma [HCO~3~^-^] to 18-21mmol.L^-1^


## Labour and Postpartum

During labour:

* MV increases 70% due to pain and increased oxygen demand
* This causes hypocapnea, so cessation of uterine contractions (and the associated pain and oxygen demand) are followed by a hypoventilatory period producing desaturation

FRC and RV return to normal within 48 hours of delivery.
