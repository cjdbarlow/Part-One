> Physiological consequences of changes in posture during pregnancy 

Pregnancy is a time of increased metabolic demand, which cardiovascular changes reflect. These changes include:

* Increased intravascular volume
Occurs via two mechanisms:
  * Increased **oestrogen** causes an **increased plasma volume**
     * This decreases capillary oncotic pressure, predisposing to oedema\
          This may be exacerbated by the gravid uterus compressing the IVC, especially near-term
    * Increased **EPO** causes an **increased red cell volume**
* Increased venous return
Due to increased intravascular volume and MSFP.
  * The gravid uterus may compress the IVC and impair VR, hence pregnant women are positioned with a left lateral tilt to displace the uterus off the IVC
* Increased VR causes an increase in CO (with both an increase in HR and SV, as well a decrease in SVR)
* Decreased SVR results in SBP, DBP and MAP dropping (despite the increase in CO)

## Magnitude of Changes by Trimester

|Parameter|Direction|First Trimester|Second Trimester|Third Trimester|Notes|Graph|
|--|:--:|--|--|
|**Plasma volume**|↑|35%|45%|50%|Peaks between 32-36^th^ week, decreases slightly thereafter|<img src="resources/maternal-volume.svg" style="width: 15pc;">|
|**Blood volume**|↑|5%|15%|20%|Increases less than plasma volume, resulting in the fall in haematocrit to 33%||
|**HR**|↑ |15%|18%|25%|Increases progressively throughout|<img src="resources/maternal-hr.svg" style="width: 15pc;">|
|**SV**|↑ |20%| 25%| 30%|Increases progressively throughout|<img src="resources/maternal-sv.svg" style="width: 15pc;">|
|**CO**|↑ |20%| 40%| 45%|Increases throughout and dramatically in labour|<img src="resources/maternal-co.svg" style="width: 15pc;">|

## Changes During Labour

* Uterine contraction boluses ~300ml of blood into the maternal circulation\
Causes an increase in CO by up to 30% during the active phase and 45% during ejection.
    * Associated with corresponding increase in SBP and DBP by 10-20mmHg


* Post-partum CO is up to 80% of pre-labour values due to autotransfusion, and returns to normal within 2 weeks of delivery
