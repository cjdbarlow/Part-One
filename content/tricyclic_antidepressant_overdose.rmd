# Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose


Tricyclic antidepressants are weak bases typically used for depression and as an adjunct for analgesia. They have a complex mechanism of action, competitively inhibiting noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake, and also blocking muscarinic receptors, histaminergic receptors, α-adrenoreceptors, GABA-a receptors, and fast sodium channels.

## Toxicity

In overdose, toxicity is predominantly due to cardiac and central effects, though there are effects on most of the major organ systems.

### Cardiac toxicity

Cardiac toxicity is due to antagonism of α-adrenoreceptors use-dependent blockade of fast sodium channels.

**α-antagonism** results in vasodilatation and subsequent **hypotension**. Hypotension may also be due to myocardial depression from sodium channel blockade.

Blockade of fast sodium channels occurs in the His-Purkinje system, as well as the atrial and ventricular myocardium. This results in **decreased myocardial impulse conduction**. They block channels in the inactivated state, resulting in a **use-dependent blockade** such that the **effect is greater at faster heart rates**. This results in an increased depolarisation and repolarisation time. ECG findings are consistent with this and are essentially pathognomonic:

* Widened QRS
* Right axis deviation of the terminal QRS\
⩾3mm terminal R wave in aVR.

Additional ECG findings include:

* Tachycardia
* Any degree of heart block
* Ventricular arrhythmias

### Central toxicity

Central toxicity is predominantly due to anticholinergic effects, though antihistaminic effects contribute.

Anti-cholinergic effects tend to occur prior to cardiac effects, and include:

* Confusion
* Agitation
* Seizures
* Pupillary dilatation and blurred vision

Antihistaminic effects include obtundation.

## Management

Standard management of poisoning applies. TCAs are not dialysable and as they are weak bases are not amenable to urinary alkalinisation.

### Cardiac toxicity

NaHCO~3~ and hyperventilation to a pH >7.5 is used to manage cardiac toxicity. There are a number of proposed mechanisms of action for the benefit of alkalinisation:

* Plasma **alkalosis** results in **less ionised drug** and **increases distribution** into tissues
* Plasma **alkalosis increases protein binding** of drug
* Intracellular alkalosis results in less bound intracellular drug, favouring its movement out of cells
* Extracellular alkalosis results in reduced H^+^/K^+^ exchange, increasing intracellular potassium and **hypopolarising the cell**.

* In addition to the alkalinising effects, sodium load from the NaHCO~3~ improves the sodium concentration gradient into cells

α-adrenoreceptor antagonism can be countered with use of an α-agonist such as noradrenaline.

Arrhythmias should be managed with drugs that do not prolong the action potential - so amiodarone and beta-blockers are contraindicated. Initial management should be using NaHCO~3~, though MgSO~4~ and lignocaine can be considered in refractory cases.

### Central toxicity

Seizures should be managed with benzodiazepines, phenytoin, propofol, and phenobarbital. Avoid agents which result in QRS prolongation.
