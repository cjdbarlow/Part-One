# Bias and Confounding

Describe bias, ~~types of error,~~ confounding factors and sample size calculations, and the factors that influence them

## Bias

Bias is a **systematic deviation from truth**, and causes a study to lack **internal validity**.

In a research study, an observed difference between groups may be due to:

* A true difference between groups
* Error\
Error can be due to:
  * Normal **random variation**, i.e. **chance**
  * A **systematic difference**, i.e. **bias**\
  Unlike error due to chance, the effect of bias cannot be reduced by increasing the sample size. 

### Types of Bias

|     Type of Bias     |                                                             Description                                                              |                            Prevention                           |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Selection**        | Where subject allocation results in treatment groups that are systematically different, apart from in the intervention being studied | Randomisation                                                   |
| **Detection**        | Where measurements are taken differently between treatment groups                                                                    | Blinding                                                        |
| **Observer**         | Where the data collector is able to be subjective about the outcome                                                                  | Blinding, Hard outcomes                                         |
| **Publication**      | When negative studies are less likely to be submitted or published than positive ones                                                | Clinical trial registries                                       |
| **Recall**           | Altered reporting of symptoms by patients depending on which group they have been allocated to                                       | Blinding                                                        |
| **Response**         | When patients who enroll for a trial differ from the population, limiting generalisability                                           | Random sampling                                                 |
| **Hawthorne Effect** | When the process of actually doing the study improves the outcome                                                                    | Control group, masking study intent from patients and observers |

## Confounder

A confounder is:

* **"A variable that, if removed, results in a change in the outcome variable by a clinically significant amount."**
* A type of bias which will result in a *distortion* of the measured effect.

A confounding factor must be:

* **Associated with the exposure** but **not a consequence of it**\
    * A confounding factor cannot be on the causal pathway between exposure and disease\
    * It must be present unevenly between groups to cause distortion of the measured effect
* **An independent predictor of outcome**\
  The confounding factor must also be a risk factor for the disease, but independently from exposure.


### Controlling For Confounding

Confounding can be controlled for:

* By **design**:
    * **Randomisation**\
    All confounders (known and unknown) are distributed evenly between groups.
    * **Restriction**\
    Restricts participants to remove confounders.
    * Results in reduced generalisability and does not control all factors
        * **Matching**\
        Pairing of similar subjects between groups.
            * May introduce additional confounding, and matching by multiple characteristics is difficult
* By **analysis**:
    * **Standardisation**\
    Adjust for differences by transforming data.
    * **Stratification**\
    Analyse the data in subgroups for each potential confounding factor.
