Describe the different types of data

Data are a series of observations or measurements, and can be either **qualitative** or **quantitative**.

## Qualitative Data

Using words as data rather than numbers, evaluating meaning and process. Common in the social sciences.

## Quantitative Data

Uses numbers, or can be coded numerically. Divided into multiple types, each with multiple subtypes.

* **Categorical**\
Data exist in **discrete categories without intrinsic order**.
  * e.g. Medical specialty (intensive care, emergency medicine, orthopaedics, cardiology)
  * Descriptive statistics for categorical data can be reported using the absolute number for each category, percentages, or proportions


* **Ordinal**\
Data exists in **discrete categories with an intrinsic order**, e.g. age groups (0-5, 6-10, 11-15...)
  * Descriptive statistics for ordinal data are the same for categorical data, but they can also be summarised by the median and the range (e.g. median age group, age group range).


* **Numeric**\
Data is an actual number. Can be subdivided into discrete or continuous:
  * **Discrete**\
Can only be recorded as an integer (whole number), e.g. number of hospital admissions.
    * **Dichotomous** or **binary** data, which occurs when there are only two categories\
  * **Continuous**\
  Where data can assume any value (including fractions), e.g. white cell count.
   * Continuous data can be further subdivided into **interval** or **ratio** data:
     * **Ratio data**\
     Are expressed with reference to a **rational zero**, which is where zero means **no measurement**.
       * e.g. Temperature in °K is a ratio variable, whilst temperature in °C is not\
       This is because 0°K means no temperature, whilst 0°C does not; e.g. 50°K is half the temperature of 100°K, but 50°C is not half the temperature of 100°C.
       * Ratio variables can (unsurprisingly) be expressed as ratios, whilst interval variables can not
     * **Interval data**\
     Do not have a rational 0 - this is just another point on the line (e.g. temperature in °C).
