:::

## Randomised Control Trial

A prospective randomised controlled trial is the **gold standard** of experimental research.

It involves allocating patients randomly to either an intervention or a reference (control) group, and measuring the outcome of interest. Allocation can be performed in three ways:

* Simple\
Individuals allocated randomly. This may lead to uneven group sizes.
* Block\
  Allocation is performed within blocks such that group sizes will remain close in size
* Stratified\
Groups are randomised within a category (i.e. men and women are randomised separately).

### Strengths

* Only study design which can establish causation
* Eliminates confounding \
Randomisation controls for both known and *unknown* confounding factors, as these should be randomly allocated between groups.
* Blinding can be performed in a standardised fashion
* Decreases selection bias

### Weaknesses

* Costly
* Time-consuming
* **Not appropriate** for **all study designs**
    * Ethical concerns\
    e.g. Adrenaline in ALS
    * Practical concerns\
    Small patient population or uncommon disease may cause recruitment difficulties


## Systematic Review

The process of evaluating all of the (quality) literature to answer a specific clinical question. These can be either:

* Meta-analysis\
Statistical analysis of multiple trials to generate a combined estimate of effect.
* Narrative reviews\
A review of several studies on a topic, aiming to draw conclusions form the totality of the evidence.

## Meta-Analysis

Mathematical technique of combining the results of different trials to derive a single pooled estimate of effect. Can be performed by:

* Pooling the results of each trial\
* Combining all of the raw data and conducting a reanalysis
    * Meta-analyses usually use **random-effects models**, which assumes there will be a variety of similar treatment effects
    * Individual trials are **summarised with an odds ratio**, and **weighted**, usually predominantly by sample size


### Stages of a Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review:

1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are predefined
2. Search: including online databases, reference lists, citations, and experts
3. Validation of potentially eligible trials (critique of interval validity, i.e. trial quality)
4. Analysis\
For a meta-analysis, this includes heterogeneity analysis.
5. Reliability of result determined\
i.e. Consistency across studies, statistical significance, large effect size, biological plausibility.
6. Sensitivity analysis\
Repeating the analysis with alternative statistical models, or excluding borderline trials or outliers. If the result is unchanged despite these changes, then the findings are more **robust**.

### Heterogeneity

For the pooling of results to be valid, the trials need to be similar. Differences between trials is known as **heterogeneity**. Heterogeneity can be either:

* **Statistical**; where the effects of the intervention are more different than would be expected to occur through chance alone. Heterogeneity analysis affects the type of model that can be used (**fixed** or **mixed effects**) and highly heterogenous data is not appropriate for meta-analysis.
* **Clinical**; where, due to trial design, it would be inappropriate to pool the results. For example, conducting a meta-analysis on the effects of the same drug in a paediatric and adult population would be inappropriate, as these are two different populations.
* **Methodological**; Where the methods used in different trials are too different to allow pooling of the data.

### Forest Plots

Results of meta-analyses are presented in a blobbogram, or more boringly, a **Forest Plot**.

<img src="resources/forest.svg">

Where:

* The **x-axis** plots the odds ratio^[NB: Remember that an OR of 1 indicates **no effect** of the intervention on the outcome.]
* The **y-axis** lists the studies included, and the overall summary statistic
* The **circles** indicate the **point estimate** (the x-location) and the **weight** (the size of the dot) given to the study
* The **horizontal lines** indicate the upper and lower bounds of the **confidence interval** for each point estimate
* The **diamond** indicates the **overall point estimate** and (by its width) the **confidence interval** for the point estimate
* The result of the heterogeneity test should also be displayed\
P < 0.1 indicates significant heterogeneity.

### Funnel Plots

A graphical tool to detect publication bias. Due to statistical power, larger studies should be a closer representation of the true effect. When evaluating an number of studies, one would expect that large studies cluster around the 'true effect' and smaller studies to have more scatter.

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Meta-analyses

:::info
Because of these weaknesses, positive meta-analyses should be considered largely hypothesis-generating, and should be confirmed by (a large) RCT
Negative meta-analyses can probably be accepted
