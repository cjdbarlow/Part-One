# Drug Approval and Development

:::CICM
Describe the processes by which new drugs are approved for research and clinical use in Australia, and to outline the phases of human drug trials (Phase I-IV)
:::

## Drug Approval

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approves medicine for both research and clinical use in Australia.

### Research

Drug trials are approved for research purposes under two schemes:\

1. Clinical Trials Exemption\
Drugs must be evaluated by an expert committee to evaluate all aspects of pharmacology, toxicology, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, organ dysfunction, and other side-effects.
2. Clinical Trials Notification\
A drug which has been approved in another nation with similarly stringent requirements (New Zealand, Netherlands, UK, Sweden, US) may be used in a trial with oversight by a local ethics committee.

### Clinical Use

The TGA classifies medicines into:

* **Registered Medicines**\
Assessed by the TGA for quality, safety, and efficacy.
    * All prescription (high-risk) medicines. Assessed on:
        * **Quality**
            * Composition of drug substance
            * Batch consistency
            * Stability data
            * Sterility data (if applicable)
            * Impurities
        * **Non-clinical**
            * Pharmacology data
            * Toxicology data
        * **Clinical**
            * Efficacy: results of clinical trials
    * Most OTC (low-risk) medicines
    * Some complementary medicines
* **Listed Medicines**\
Assessed by the TGA for quality, safety, but not efficacy.
    * Some OTC medicines
    * Most complementary medicines

## Phases of Drug Development

* **"Phase 0"**
    * Pre-clinical R&D
    * *In vitro* and animal testing
* **Phase I**
    * First administration in healthy human volunteers
    * Basic pharmacokinetic and toxicology data
    * 20 - 100 human subjects
* **Phase II**
    * Administration to select patient groups
    * Aim to establish dose-response curve
    * Evidence of efficacy and safety in the target population\
    Usually surrogate outcome measures.
* **Phase III**
    * Full-scale evaluation of benefits, potential risks and costs analysis
    * 2000-3000 patients, usually treated in groups of several hundred for relatively short durations (3-6 months), regardless of the length of time the drug will be used in practice[^3]
    * May not reveal uncommon or long-term risks
* **Phase IV**
    * Post-marketing surveillance
