# Fat Metabolism

> Describe the physiology and biochemistry of fat~~, carbohydrate and protein~~ metabolism

## Digestion

Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in animals and vegetables, and therefore in dietary fat. They consist of **three fatty acid** molecules joined by a **glycerol molecule**.

As fats are not water soluble, they tend to clump together in chyme and are hard to digest due to the low surface area:volume ratio. **Emulsification** speeds up the digestive process, and occurs via the action of:

* Bile salts\
  Many bile salts have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end, which give a detergent action. Bile salts bound to fatty acids form a **mixed micelle** which can be further digested by enzymes or directly absorbed.
* Partially digested fats 
* Mechanical action of the stomach

Once emulsified, triglycerides can be hydrolysed by **lipase** into fatty acids and monoacylglycerol.

## Absorption

Absorption occurs in a number of stages:

* Mixed micelles, free fatty acids, monoacylglycerol, and cholesterols are absorbed via facilitated diffusion into the enterocyte
* From the enterocyte:
  * Short-chain fatty acids (those with < 12 carbon atoms) enter the portal vein and travel directly to the liver
  * Long-chain fatty acids are re-esterified and packaged with a layer of **protein** and **cholesterol** to form a ** chylomicron**\
  Re-esterification maintains the concentration gradient for diffusion of fatty acids, allowing further uptake to occur.
    * Chylomicrons are ejected from the cell into the lymphatics and travel to the systemic circulation
    * Chylomicrons are removed from circulation by **lipoprotein lipase**\
    Lipoprotein lipase is found on capillary endothelium and bound to albumin.
    * Lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglyceride in chylomicrons and VLDL to free fatty acids and glycerol\
    This reaction uses **heparin** as a **cofactor**.
    * Free fatty acids and glycerol are then free to enter adipose tissue

## Storage

Fat is stored as **triglycerides**, and forms the bulk of energy storage of the body.

Triglycerides are synthesised by the liver:

* Occurs when insulin levels are high and glycogen stores are full
* From excess carbohydrate and amino acids\
These are converted to fatty acids and glycerol, and then esterified to form triglyceride. This is known as lipogenesis.

## Metabolism

Free fatty acids can be absorbed by adipocytes for storage, or be **Î²-oxidised to acetyl CoA** in the liver, which can enter the citric acid cycle to produce ATP.
