# Basal Metabolic Rate

> Describe basal metabolic rate and its measurement

> Outline the factors that influence metabolic rate

**Basal Metabolic Rate** is the **energy output required to sustain life at rest**.
* 'Resting' is defined as an individual who is:
    * Fasted for 12 hours
    * In a comfortable external environment
    * At mental and physical rest 
* Normal values are:
    * 100W.day^-1^
    * 70kcal.hr^-1^
  \
  \
**Metabolic rate** is the actual energy consumption of an individual, and is greater than BMR due to a number of factors.

## Factors Affecting Metabolic Rate

Metabolic Rate is affected by:

* **Age**\
BMR decreases as age increases.
    * Neonates have a BMR twice that of an adult
    * Children have an increased BMR relative to that of an adult
    * BMR declines by 2% for each decade of life
* **Body Composition**\
Lean muscle has a greater energy requirement than fat.
    * Higher body fat percentage results in a lower BMR
        * Females have a lower BMR for this reason - when adjusted for lean mass there is no difference
* **Diet**
    * Digestion increases BMR by ~10% due to the energy required to assimilate nutrients\
    This is known as the **specific dynamic action** of food.
        * Protein > carbohydrate > fat\
        Note that the Specific Dynamic Action for each macromolecule is not related to the respiratory quotient for that food type.          \
    * Starvation decreases the BMR
* **Exercise**
    * Skeletal muscle is the largest and most variable source of energy consumption
* **Environment**
    * Cooler environments increase BMR 
    * Temperate environments decrease BMR up to 10%
* **Physiological state**s
    * Pregnancy increases BMR up to 20% in 2nd and 3rd trimester
    * Lactation increases BMR
    * Catecholamines increase BMR
    * Corticosteroids increase BMR
* **Disease states**
    * Malignancy increases BMR
    * Sepsis increases BMR
    * Hyperthyroidism increases BMR  \


## Measurement of BMR using Indirect Calorimetry

BMR is measured using **indirect calorimetry**, which calculates heat production via measurement of VO~2~ and VCO~2~. A number of methods exists depending on whether the patient is intubated or not, or whether they are requiring supplementary oxygen.

In general:

* Patients should be relaxed and fasted
* FiO~2~ needs to be calculated (or taken from the ventilator settings), and E~T~CO~2~ and E~T~O~2~ must be measured
* Steady-state should be achieved across a five minute period
    * The average MVO~2~ and MVCO~2~ changes by <10%
    * The respiratory quotient ($RQ = { VCO_2 \over VO_2 }$) change by <5%
        * This ratio will vary depending on the substances metabolised:
            * Carbohydrates = 1
            * Protein ≈ 0.8
            * Fat ≈ 0.7

Resting Energy Expenditure is given by the **abbreviated Weir equation**:

$REE = 3.94 \times (FiO_2 - E_TO_2 ) + (1.1 \times VCO_2) $in Watts per unit time of measurement.

### Errors in Indirect Calorimetry

* Air leaks and measurement errors
* Measures consumption (rather than requirements)
* Point estimate of a dynamic process

## Footnotes

The **respiratory quotient** is the value of $VCO_2 \over VO_2 $at steady-state, whilst the **respiratory exchange ratio** is affected by metabolic rate.
