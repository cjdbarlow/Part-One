# 2018B Question 02 

Discuss the factors that affect oxygen transport from the alveoli to the tissues.


## Examiner Report

34% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


Five topics could earn marks if correctly described and discussed.
* Oxygen cascade diagram
* Alveolar gas equation
* Fick’s Law of diffusion
* Oxygen flux equation
* Haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve


Most candidates mentioned Fick’s Law and component factors affecting diffusion. There was a large emphasis on time versus perfusion limiting of diffusion and little discussion of the partial pressure gradient driving diffusion. Relatively few candidates described the alveolar gas equation. Most candidates mentioned the oxygen flux equation and the components of oxygen content of blood. Around half discussed the haemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve and factors affecting unloading of oxygen in the tissues.


A small number of candidates correctly mentioned shunt and several candidates incorrectly mentioned alveolar dead space as factors impacting alveolar to arterial partial pressure gradient.


No candidate discussed the role of oxygen consumption by mitochondria as the primary motive force for movement of oxygen.

## Model Answer

Structure:
- Introduction
- Alveolus → Pulmonary capillary
- Pulmonary capillary → Systemic arterial blood
- Systemic arterial blood → Tissues

### Introduction
