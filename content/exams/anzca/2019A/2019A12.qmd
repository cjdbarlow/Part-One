# 2019A Question 12 

Outline the factors that determine the rate of recovery from non-depolarising neuromuscular block.


## Examiner Report

42% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


Candidates who were able to grasp the significance of the factors that change the offset duration and explain why this occurred typically scored very well in this question. Broadly the topics for which marks were allocated were: Drug dosing; type of agent; metabolism; effect of acetylcholine receptor changes; effect of altered physiological states; significant drug-drug interactions and reversal agents.


Many candidates demonstrated an excellent understanding of one or two areas but were let down by omitting from their discussion other areas altogether (typically metabolism and reversal agents).

## Model Answer

Structure:
- Introduction
- Initial drug concentration
- Biophasics\
Rate of transfer from effect site to central compartment.
- Kinetics\
Rate of ↓ [drug].
- Dynamics\
[Drug] for offset (could technically write about ↑ sensitivity and ↓ sensitivity).

### Introduction


|Property|Detail|

|Determinants of Time to Recovery|<p>- Final effect site concentration after bolus or at end of infusion</p><p>- Rate of removal from effect site</p><p>- Rate of elimination from the plasma</p><p>- Effect site concentration required for recovery of neuromuscular function</p>|

### Effect Site Concentration Required for Drug Offset
