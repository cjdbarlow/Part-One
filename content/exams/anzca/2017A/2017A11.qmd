# 2017A Question 11 


Draw an expiratory flow-volume curve obtained from a maximal expiratory effort after a vital capacity breath, for a person with: <br> a) normal lungs <br> b) restrictive lung disease <br> c) obstructive lung disease (10 marks)<br><br>Explain how and why these curves (and the derived parameters) are different for each disease state (15 marks)


## Examiner Report

39.9% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


Good answers included a representative diagram and demonstrated understanding of how the
disease states alter respiratory mechanics and why this leads to the differences seen between
the three curves. Almost all candidates that failed drew a diagram with significant errors and
their subsequent explanations were insufficient to make up for this.


Common problems:

* Incorrect units, units without values or units with grossly incorrect values. A peak
expiratory flow of 6 - 10L/min was frequently quoted despite normal minute
ventilation at rest being in this range
* Drawing three separate graphs without making it clear how they differ from each other
* Drawing flow-time or volume-time curves
* Drawing peak flows that where the same or higher in the disease states compared to
the normal lung curve
* Incorrect changes to residual volume and total lung capacity
* Confusing vital capacity and total lung capacity
* Incorrect or vague explanations as to why the curves differ


No marks were awarded for drawing inspiratory curves or discussing work of breathing, tidal
volumes or functional residual capacity. Discussion of time related values such as FEV1 and
FEV1/FVC also attracted no marks as they cannot be readily obtained from these curves.

### Relevant Physiology


|Factor|Mechanism|

|Resistance|<p>- Laminar flow (small airways): $Resistance = {8 \times length \times viscosity \over \pi \times radius^4}$</p><p>- Turbulent flow (large airways): $P1-P2 \propto length \times {density \over radius^5}$</p><p>- Factors ↓ AWR</p><p>&emsp;- ↑ Radius (most important since raised to power 4 or 5)</p><p>&emsp;- ↓ Viscosity (e.g. Temp)</p><p>&emsp;- ↓ Density (e.g. Heliox vs. air)</p><p>&emsp;- ↓ Length (not under control)</p>|

### Normal Flow-Volume Loop


|Variable|Mechanism|
| -- | -- |
|TLC|<p>- Lung volume after maximal inspiratory effort</p><p>- Note unable to measure with flow-volume loop</p>|
|Upward slope|<p>- Effort-dependent</p><p>- Radial traction distends airways</p>|
|Max PEFR|<p>- Occurs at beginning of forced expiration.</p><p>&emsp;- Highest lung elastic recoil</p><p>&emsp;- Highest airway radius</p><p>&emsp;- ?High expiratory muscle mechanical advantage</p><p>- Reflects larger airway function</p><p>- Mainly effort-dependent</p><p>- Limited by onset of DAC</p>|
|Linear decline|<p>- Mainly effort-independent, especially FEF25-75%</p><p>- Decline due to increasing DAC as lung volume and airway radii fall</p><p>- Mostly effort independent</p><p>- Reflects smaller airway function</p>|
|RV|<p>- Maximal expiration</p><p>- Limited by small airway closure</p><p>- Note unable to measure with flow-volume loop</p>|
|FVC|<p>- FVC = TLC - RV</p>|

### Obstructive Pathophysiology

|↑/↓ TLC|<p>- COPD with emphysema: ↓ Elastic recoil</p><p>- Asthma: Gas trapping, elastic recoil may be maintained</p>|
|↓ Upward slope|<p>- Cause: ↓ Airway radius</p>|
|↓ PEFR|<p>- ↓ Airway radius</p><p>- Earlier and exaggerated DAC, distal migration of EPP</p>|
|Linear decline|<p>- Scooped out appearance, ↓ FEF25-75%</p><p>&emsp;- Earlier and exaggerated DAC, distal migration of EPP</p><p>&emsp;- (If emphysema: ↓ Radial traction, ↓ lung recoil)</p><p>- Changes ∝ severity</p>|
|↑ RV|<p>- ↓ Airway radius → Earlier airway closure</p><p>- (If emphysema: ↓ lung recoil, earlier airway closure)</p>|
|↓ FVC|<p>- $\Delta RV > \Delta TLC$</p>|

### Restrictive Pathophysiology

|↔↓ Max PEFR|<p>- (affected in severe disease)</p><p>- ↓ Lung compliance</p>|
|Linear decline|<p>- ↔↑ Slope, especially at end-expiration</p><p>&emsp;- ↑ Lung recoil → ↑ Transpulmonary pressure</p><p>&emsp;- Stiff, less collapsible tissue</p>|
|↓ RV|<p>- ↑ Lung recoil → Airway closure at lower lung volume</p>|
