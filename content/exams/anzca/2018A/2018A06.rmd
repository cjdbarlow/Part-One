# 2018A Question 06 

Describe the washout (not offset) of sevoflurane from a patient following two hours of general anaesthesia. You may wish to use a graph to illustrate the description.


## Examiner Report

54% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.

To achieve a pass in this question the following were required :

* A clear explanation of the elimination kinetics of Sevoflurane with due consideration to a time course appropriate to the termination of anaesthesia after two hours
* A washout graph including appropriate axis labelling, a multi exponential decay curve, time course and half times consistent with volatile washout\
It was very difficult to pass the question without a washout graph. Wash-in graphs did not score points.
* A description of the movement of Sevoflurane out of the alveolus, from plasma to alveolus, from the various compartments to plasma and their respective time courses and a description of factors which underpin those kinetics; including depth and duration of anaesthesia, alveolar ventilation and fresh gas flows, compartmental blood flows and solubilities


Common errors included:

* Confused graphs with no or inappropriate time courses indicated, nonsensical axis labelling or graphing of wash-in and wash-out on the same graph
* Detailed descriptions of Fick’s Law which wasted time and did not score points
* An overemphasis on the role of cardiac output in washout and incorrect assertions that increased cardiac output speeds washout
* Conflation of washout and awakening from anaesthetic as the same thing
* The incorrect assertion that following two hours the fat is completely saturated with Sevoflurane
* The confusion of partial pressures, concentrations and amounts


## Model Answer

Structure:
- Emergence modeling
- Final end-tidal partial pressure
- Elimination from V~1~

	
### Emergence Modeling

Washout time is a function of:

* Final partial pressure in effect site prior to washout
* Rate of elimination from V~1~

Compartment saturation at two hours:

|Compartment|τ|Capacity|Saturation|
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|V~1~|5.7 mins|Low|~100%|
|V~2~|2.3 hours|Moderate|~50%|
|V~5~|1.8 days|High|Minimal|

* Equilibration time constants:
	* τ= 1/k
	* τ= (V x λ) / Q
	* Where: (V = volume of tissue, λ = tissue: Blood partition coefficient, Q = blood flow)

### Final Effect-Site Partial Pressure

Effect site partial pressure:
- Correlates with that in V~1~
- May not be included in all kinetic models
- Rate of equilibration between effect site and V~1~ is:
	- $\propto$CBF (per unit mass, not percentage CO to brain)
	- $\propto {1 \over Brain-blood \ partition \ coefficient}$
