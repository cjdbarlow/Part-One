# 2021A Question 12

Define the terms “tolerance” and “tachyphylaxis”. Discuss the different mechanisms by which tolerance can develop, giving examples where appropriate.


## Examiner Report

48.2% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


The domains which attracted marks for this question were:

* Correct definition of both tachyphylaxis and tolerance
* Mechanisms for tachyphylaxis with examples
* Mechanisms for tolerance with examples


Common problems with the answers included:

* Not stating time course for these effects
* Confounding tolerance with ceiling effect/zero order kinetics/drug interactions
* Using phenylephrine as an example of an indirectly acting drug
* Confusing transmitter depletion with re-uptake inhibition


## Model Answer

Structure:

- Tachyphylaxis: Definition, cause, examples
- Tolerance: Same
- Mechanisms of tolerance

### Tachyphylaxis


|Property|Detail|
| -- | -- |
|Definition|<p>- Decreased response to a drug with repeated short-term use</p><p>- Usually over minutes to hours</p><p>- Cannot be easily overcome with increased dose</p>|
|Cause|Usually mediator depletion|
|Examples|<p>- Ephedrine: Depletion of NAd at post-ganglionic SNS nerve endings</p><p>- GTN: Depletion of intracellular sulfhydryl groups → ↓ Nitric oxide release</p>|

### Tolerance


|Property|Detail|
| -- | -- |
|Definition|<p>- Decreased duration then decreased magnitude of effect of a given drug dose with long term use</p><p>- Usually over days to weeks</p><p>- Can be overcome with increased dose</p>|
|Cause| Chronic use of drug resulting in adaptation|
|Examples| e.g. Chronic opioid use|
|Representation|<p>Right shift log(dose) – response curve</p><p><img src="resources/fatex.svg"></p>|

### Mechanisms of Tolerance


|Factor|Mechanism|
| -- | -- |
|Kinetic|<p>- Absorption/metabolism</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Alcohol → Induce alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase</p><p>- Distribution:</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. ↑ P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of opioids</p>|
|Dynamic|<p>- ↓ Receptor number</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Salbutamol at β~2~ adrenoceptor</p><p>&emsp;- Phosphorylate ICF carboxyl terminal → Β-arrestin binds → Internalize & destroy</p><p>- ↓ Receptor affinity</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Contributes to insulin resistance</p><p>- ↓ ICF signal transduction</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Morphine at mu receptor</p><p>&emsp;- Upregulation of cAMP system → ↓ Effect of Gi G protein coupled receptor activation</p><p>- Altered ion conductance</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Suxamethonium phase 2 blockade</p><p>&emsp;- Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues → Conformational change</p><p>- Neuroplasticity:</p><p>&emsp;- e.g. Cocaine effect on basal ganglia</p><p>&emsp;- ↓ Euphoria</p><p>- Upregulation of antagonistic mechanism</p>|
