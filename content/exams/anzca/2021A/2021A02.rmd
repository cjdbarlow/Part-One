# 2021A Question 2

Describe the individual effects of propofol and sevoflurane on the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO~2~) and cerebral blood flow (CBF).


## Examiner Report

35.9% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


The major domains assessed in this question were:

* The effect of propofol on CMRO2
* The effect of propofol on CBF
* The effect of sevoflurane on CMRO2
* The effect of sevoflurane on CBF


Both agents decrease CMRO2 by inhibition neuronal activity through enhanced GABA mechanisms. The maximum reduction is 50-60% because a baseline of 40% CMRO2 is required for neuronal maintenance.


Significant weight was given to a clear demonstration of:

1. The triphasic nature of the MAC/CBF relationship for sevoflurane
2. A clear description of the direct association of decreased CMRO2 caused by propofol with a proportional decrease in CBF due to flow metabolism coupling.


The commonest misconception was that a decrease in CBF associated with propofol was due to its systemic circulatory effects causing hypotension. This is only relevant at the lower limit of the auto regulatory curve. A number of candidates suggested that reduction in CBF caused by propofol was “prevented” because auto regulation “was preserved”. Some candidates suggested that the CMRO2 is determined by CBF, reflecting a major misunderstanding of cerebral physiology.


Discussions of other physiological or pathological factors affecting CBF and CMRO2 not relating to the effect of propofol or sevoflurane did not attract marks.

## Model Answer


### Sevoflurane


|Relationship|Detail|
| -- | -- |
|CMRO~2~ vs MAC|<p>- Dose-dependent reduction in electrophysiological function (60% of total)</p><p>- No effect on basal function (40% of total) – only reduced by hypothermia</p><p><img src="resources/cbf-cmro2-sevo.svg"><p>- Exponential decay → Greater effect at low dose</p>|
|CBF vs CMRO~2~|<p>- Dose-dependent vasodilatation (↓ L-Ca^2+^ activity, ↑ NO activity)</p><p>- Coupling of CBF and CMRO~2~ impaired (not ablated)</p><p><img src="resources/cbf-cmro2-volatile.svg"></p><p>- Slope ∝ dose → Greater effect at high dose</p>|
|CBF vs MAC|<p>- At low concentration: Indirect vasoconstriction (via ↓ CMRO~2~) wins</p><p>- At high concentration: Direct vasodilatation more significant</p>|
|Other|<p>- Luxury perfusion: Due to ↓ CMRO~2~ but ↑ CBF</p><p>- Hypoventilation: ↑ PaCO~2~ may cause further vasodilatation (if spont vent)</p>|


## Propofol


|Relationship|Detail|
| -- | -- |
|CMRO~2~ vs Ce|<p>- As sevoflurane</p>|
|CMRO~2~ vs CBF|<p>- Coupling of CBF and CMRO~2~ unaffected</p>|
|CBF vs Ce|<p>- Dose-dependent ↓ CBF (ideal agent in intracranial hypertension)</p><p>- Exponential decay</p>|
|Other|<p>- ↑↑ Propofol Ce → ↓ SVR → ↓ MAP → ↓ Perfusion</p><p>- Autoregulation exhausted if MAP ≤50mmHg</p>|
