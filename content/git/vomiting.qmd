# Vomiting

:::CICM
Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including (oesophageal) sphincter function.

:::ANZCA
Explain the physiology of nausea and vomiting.
:::

Vomiting is the active, forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the stomach. Vomiting is:

* Distinct from regurgitation, which is a passive process
* A mechanism to expel toxic substances from the GIT

## Stimulation

Stimulants for vomiting are divided into:

* **Central stimuli**\
Central stimuli may act:
    * Directly on the vomiting centre\
    Include:
        * Emotion
        * Pain
        * Olfactory
        * Visual
    * Via the chemoreceptor trigger zone\
    The CTZ is is part of the **area postrema**, and is located outside of the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the CTZ can be stimulated by circulating substances that have not crossed the BBB. Stimuli include:
        * Vestibular stimuli, acting via:
            * H~1~ receptors
            * ACh receptors
        * Drugs/Toxins acting on:
            * 5-HT~3~
            * D~2~
            * μ-opioid receptors
* **GIT stimulation**\
GIT stimuli travel SNS and PNS afferents to the vomiting centre, and include **distension** and **toxins**. Neurotransmitters include:
    * 5-HT~3~ in mucosal stretch receptors
    * ACh in NTS afferents
    * H~1~ in NTS afferents

As CTZ is not involved in GIT-driven vomiting, anti-emetics which act there are typically ineffective.

### Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting

Central structures involved include:

* Chemoreceptor trigger zone
* NTS
* Multiple pathways exist (similar to those described above), and neurotransmitters involved include:
    * 5-HT~3~
    * D~2~
    * NK~1~
    * H~1~
    * mACh
* Risk factors
    * Patient factors
        * Female
        * Non-Smoker
        * Young age
        * History of PONV or motion sickness
    * Anaesthetic factors
        * Volatile use
        * Nitrous oxide use\
        Relative risk of 1.4.
        * Opioid use
        * Anaesthesia duration
    * Surgical factors
        * Gynaecological surgery\
        Likely not an independent risk factor, and simply confounded by female gender.
        * Strabismus surgery in children

## Process of Vomiting

Vomiting consists of a set of processes coordinated by the **vomit centre** in the medulla oblongata, and is divided into three phases:

* **Pre-ejection phase**
    * Prodromal nausea
    * Salivation
    * Retrograde intestinal contraction which forces intestinal contents into the stomach
* **Retching Phase**
    * Deep inspiration and breath-holding to splint the chest
    * Epiglottic closure
    * Elevation of the soft palate (prevents nasal soiling)
* **Expulsive phase**
    * Relaxation of oesophageal sphincters
    * Pyloric contraction
    * Violent contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles
