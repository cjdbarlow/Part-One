# Functions of the Liver


> Describe the storage, synthetic, metabolic and excretory functions of the liver

## Storage

The liver is important in storage and release of:

* Carbohydrates as glycogen\
The adult liver stores ~100g of glycogen.
* Fat as triglycerides
* All fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
* Many water soluble vitamins including folic acid and B~12~
* Iron
* Copper

## Synthetic

Synthetic functions include:

* **Bile production**
* Plasma proteins including:
  * Clotting factors
  * Albumin production\
  120-300mg.kg^-1^ of albumin is produced per day, dependent on nutritional status, plasma oncotic pressure, and endocrine function. 

## Metabolic

Metabolic functions include:

* Carbohydrate
* Fat
* Protein
* Bilirubin metabolism
* Drugs and Toxins

### Carbohydrates

* Monosaccharides and disaccharides passively diffuse into hepatocytes\
Gradient is maintained by converting glucose to glucose-6-phosphate which is used to produce glycogen. This maintains the gradient for diffusion.
* Glycogen is either synthesised (glycogenesis) or broken down (glycogenolysis) depending on plasma glucose and insulin:
  * Increased blood glucose stimulates insulin release, increasing the formation of glycogen through activation of glycogen synthetase
  * Decreased blood glucose stimulates glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from amino acids.

### Lipids

* Fat can be:
  * Stored as triglycerides
  * Hydrolysed to glycerol and fatty acids, which is used for ATP production


### Proteins and Urea

Amino acids are absorbed from blood to be used for gluconeogenesis and for protein synthesis. In order to produce substrates for the CAC, Amino acids may be:

* Transaminated
* Deaminated
* Decarboxylated

The nitrogenous scrap of these reactions is urea, which is produced in several stages:

* A variety of metabolic processes convert amino acids to **glutamate**
* Glutamate is converted to **ammonia** by glutamate dehydrogenase
* Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to produce (surprisingly) urea, at the cost of **3 ATP**
  * A normal diet of 100g protein per day produces ~30g of urea, and 1000mmol of hydrogen ions

## Endocrine

* Produces angiotensinogen
* Produces IGF-1
* Converts T4 to T3


## Immunoprotective

* **Kupffer** cells\
Tissue macrophages of the hepatic reticuloendothelial system. They phagocytose harmful substances including:
  * Endotoxins
  * Bacteria
  * Viruses
  * Immune complexes
  * Thrombin
  * Fibrin complexes
  * Tumour cells

## Acid-Base Balance

May produce or consume large numbers of hydrogen ions:

* Carbon dioxide production
* Metabolism of organic acid anions
  * Lactate
  * Ketones
  * Amino acids
* Ammonium
* Production of plasma proteins\
Notably albumin
