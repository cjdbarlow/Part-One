# Oesophagus

> Describe the control of gastrointestinal motility, including sphincter function.

The oesophagus is a muscular tube connecting the pharynx to the stomach. The oesophagus has:

* **Skeletal muscle** in its **upper third**
* **Smooth muscle** in its **lower third**

## Lower Oesophageal Sphincter

The LoS is:

* The most distal **2-4cm** of the oesophagus
* Macroscopically indistinguishable from the rest of the oesophagus
    * However it has a higher concentration of nerve cells and is able to constrict at a higher pressure
* Tonically innervated by the vagus
* Important in the prevention of reflux\
Competency of the LoS is required to prevent reflux
    * **Barrier pressure is** the pressure difference between the pressure at the lower oesophageal sphincter and the pressure in the stomach, and is typically **~15-25mmHg**\
    Barrier pressure is affected by:
        * Changes in lower oesophageal sphincter pressure
            * Swallowing\
            Barrier pressure decreases during swallowing, and transiently increases immediately afterwards.
            * Anatomical
                * Age\
                Sphincter tone is decreased in neonates and the elderly.
                * Diaphragm\
                An external sphincter is formed by the diaphragmatic crura, and exerts a **pinch-cock** action on the oesophagus.
                * Stomach\
                A fold in the stomach wall just distal to the GOJ creates a **flap valve**, which occludes the GOJ when gastric pressure rises.
                * Oesophagus\
                The oesophagus enters the stomach at an oblique angle, limiting retrograde flow.
            * Hormonal
                * Gastrin, motilin, Î±-agonism **increase** LoS tone
                * Progesterone, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) **decrease** LoS tone
            * Drugs\
                * ETOH, IV and volatile anaesthetic agents, and anticholinergics **decrease** LoS tone
                * Suxamethonium, metoclopramide, and anticholinesterases **increase** LoS tone
        * Changes in gastric pressure
            * Raised intraabdominal pressure
                * Obesity
                * Pregnancy\
        * Disease
            * Hiatus hernia\
            GOJ moves into the thorax, causing:
                * Loss of pinch-cock action
                * Negative intrathoracic pressure reduces LoS pressure and therefore barrier pressure
