# Intercostal Catheter

:::CICM
Describe the anatomy relevant to the insertion of an intercostal catheter
:::

An intercostal catheter drains the intrapleural space.

## Surface Anatomy

An ICC should be placed in the **safe triangle**:

![Safe Triangle](/resources/safe_triangle.png)

This is bordered:

* **Anteriorly** by pectoralis major
* **Posteriorly** by latissimus dorsi\
    Too far posterior will injure the long thoracic nerve.
* **Superiorly** by the base of the axilla
* **Inferiorly** by the 5^th^ intercostal space\
    Too far inferiorly risks placement in the liver or spleen.

## Layers of Dissection

* Skin
* Subcutaneous tissue
* External intercostal
* Internal and innermost intercostal muscles\
  Note the **neurovascular bundle** which sits on the inferior aspect of the ribs, therefore aim to place the ICC at the bottom of the intercostal space - "above the rib below".
* Parietal pleura
