# Antecubital Fossa


> Describe the anatomy relevant to central venous access (including ~~femoral, internal jugular, external jugular, subclavian and~~ peripheral veins)

The antecubital fossa is a **triangular space** on the anterior aspect of the forearm.

## Borders

The triangular borders are formed:

* Medially by pronator teres
* Laterally by brachioradialis
* Superiorly by an imaginary line between the medial and lateral epicondyles

* The roof of the fossa is formed by subcutaneous tissue
* The floor is formed by brachialis and supinator

## Contents

From medial to lateral:

* Median nerve
* Brachial artery
* Biceps tendon and aponeurosis
* Radial and posterior interosseous nerves
* Veins
    * Basilic vein
    * Cephalic vein
    * Venous variations:
        * A median cubital vein connecting the basilic and cephalic veins
        * A median vein of the forearm, which divides into a median basilic and median cephalic vein which drain into the basilic and cubital veins
