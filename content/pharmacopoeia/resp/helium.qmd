# Helium


Helium is an inert gas which is used to reduce the specific gravity of inhaled gas mixtures. It is typically provided as a 0.79/0.21 Helium-Oxygen (Heliox) mixture (though other dilutions exist).

||Helium|Heliox (0.79/0.21)|Oxygen|
|--|
|**Specific Gravity** (as compared to air)|0.18|0.34|1.09|

Reduced specific gravity results in a proportional reduction in Reynolds Number, improving laminar flow within the airways.

|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Class**|Inert Gas|
|**Uses**|Obstructive lung disease, deep water diving|
|**Presentation**|Clear, colourless solution|
|**Route of Administration**|Inhaled|
|**Dosing**|Typically as Heliox: 79% He/21% O~2~|
|**Absorption**|Diffusion across the alveolar capillary membrane in proportion to membrane area and partial pressure gradient, and inversely proportional to membrane thickness|
|**Distribution**|Distributes proportionally to solubility and tissue partial pressures|
|**Metabolism**|Not metabolised|
|**Elimination**|Respiratory exhalation along a pressure gradient|
|**Resp**|Significantly decreases the specific gravity of inhaled gas mixtures|
|**Toxic Effects**|High Pressure Neurologic Syndrome at >16 atm|
