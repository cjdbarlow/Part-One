# Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors


ACE inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs, in turn reducing effects of angiotensin II. These effects include:

* Vasoconstriction
* Noradrenaline reuptake inhibition
* Thirst
* ADH release
* ACTH release
* Aldosterone release
* Reduces Kf, reducing GFR

## Indications 

 * **Hypertension**\
  * Particularly in insulin dependent diabetes with diabetic nephropathy
  * Less effective for this indication in the black population
  * Contribute to post-operative hypertension and may be withheld perioperatively
 
 
 * **Cardiac failure**\
All grades.

* **MI with LV dysfunction**\
  Improved prognosis.

## Classification

Can be divided into three groups based on pharmacokinetics:

* Active drug with active metabolites\
Captopril.
* Prodrug\
Ramipril.
* Not metabolised and excreted unchanged in urine\
Lisinopril.

## Common Features of ACE Inhibitors

|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Resp**|Bradykinin cough
|**CVS**|↓ SVR and BP. Unaffected HR and baroreceptor response.
|**Endocrine**|Hypoglycaemia in diabetics
|**Renal**|With a normal renal perfusion pressure, natriuresis results. However, a fall in renal perfusion pressure may cause pre-renal failure (e.g. renal artery stenosis).
|**Haeme**|Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia
|**Immune**|Angioedema
|**Metabolic**| ↑ Renin release.
|**Interactions**|↓ Aldosterone release, which ↑ the efficacy of spironolactone and may precipitate hyperkalaemia. Pharmacodynamic interaction with NSAIDs to drop renal perfusion pressure.
