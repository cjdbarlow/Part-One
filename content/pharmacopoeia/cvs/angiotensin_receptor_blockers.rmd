# Angiotensin Receptor Blockers


Angiotensin receptor antagonists are very similar to ACE inhibitors, except:

* Bradykinin does not accumulate as it is still broken down by ACE\
Therefore there is no cough and patient compliance is improved.
* The AT~1~ receptor in cardiac tissue is more comprehensively blocked which *may* improve cardiac outcomes
* The AT~2~ receptor is not blocked, which *may* also improve cardiac outcomes
