# Direct Vasodilators


Direct vasodilators include:

* Ca^2+^ channel blockers (see [Calcium Channel Blockers](calcium_channel_blockers.md))
* Nitrates\
Increase production of NO:
	* NO activates guanylate cyclase, increasing cGMP
	* cGMP inhibits Ca^2+^ uptake into smooth muscle and enhances its sequestration into smooth endoplasmic reticulum\
	The decrease in cytoplasmic [Ca^2+^] causes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation
* Hydralazine\
Multimodal mechanism of action, including:
	* Opens K^+^ channels, hyperpolarising vascular smooth muscle
	* Decreases intracellular Ca^2+^ in vascular smooth muscle
	* Activation of guanylate cyclase

# Nitrate Toxicity

Nitrate toxicity can be related to:

* Cyanide
* Thiocyanate
* Methaemoglobinaemia

### Cyanide Toxicity

Cyanide toxicity occurs only with SNP, as CN^-^ is produced as a byproduct of metabolism or the effect of light.
* **Kinetics**\
	* Rapid cellular uptake
	* Small V~D~
	* Hepatically metabolised to **thiocyanate**, using thiosulfate as a substrate
* **Mechanism**\
CN^-^ binds to cytochrome oxidase, preventing oxidative phosphorylation. This causes histotoxic hypoxia, and is characterised by:
	* Rapid loss of consciousness and seizures
	* Metabolic acidosis
	* Lactataemia
	* Arrhythmia
	* Increased MVO~2~
	* Hypertension\
	Due to tachyphylaxis to SNP.
* Risk of cyanide toxicity from SNP is related to:
	* Infusion rate
	* Infusion duration
* **Management**
	* Supportive care, including inotropes
	* Cyanide chelators\
	Bind CN^^, removing it from the circulation. Include:
		* Dicobalt edetate
		* Hydroxycobalamin (Vitamin B~12~)
		* Sulfur donors\
		Provide additional sulfhydryl groups, allowing further hepatic metabolism of CN^-^ to SCN. Include:
			* **Thiosulfate**
		* Nitrites\
		Converts Oxy-Hb to Met-Hb, which has a higher affinity for CN^-^ than cytochrome oxidase. Include:
			* Sodium nitrite
			* Amyl nitrite

### Thiocyanate Toxicity

Thiocyante is produced with hepatic metabolism of CN^-^. Toxicity occurs when thiocyanate accumulates, which occurs in:

* Long duration SNP infusions\
7-14 days.
* Patients with renal failure\
Reduced clearance, may occur in 3-6 days.
* Patients given thiosulfate for management of CN^-^ toxicity.


* **Effects**\
Multisystemic, including:
	* Rash
    * Abdominal pain
    * Weakness
    * CNS disturbance


* **Treatment**\
    * Dialysis

### Methaemoglobinaemia

Methaemoglobinaemia occurs when the Fe^2+^ (ferrous) ion in haemoglobin is oxidised to the Fe^3+^ (ferric) form, which is **unable** to **bind oxygen**.
* Due to the high concentration of oxygen in erythrocytes, methaemoglobin is continually being formed
* Several endogenous reduction systems exist to keep MetHb levels stable at ~1%
	* Predominantly cytochrome-*b*~5~ reductase
	* NADPH-MHb reductase\
	This reduces methaemoglobinaemia in the presence of a reducing agent, classically **methylene blue**.
	* Reduced glutathione\
	More important in preventing oxidative stress in other cells than the RBC.
* Disease occurs due to the loss in oxygen-carrying capacity from the loss of effective haemoglobin\
	* e.g. a 20% MetHb level gives a *theoretical* oxygen carrying capacity of 80% of the actual haemoglobin\
	There is in fact a slight **left shift** of the **oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve**, as oxygen binds more tightly to the partially-oxidised haemoglobin.
