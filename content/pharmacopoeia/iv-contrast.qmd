## Intravenous Contrast{#id}


Intravenous contrast may be divided into:

* **X-ray Contrast**\
These agents are all based on a tri-iodinated benzene ring, which absorbs x-ray radiation. Alterations to this ring alter toxicity, lipophilicity, and elimination.
    * Agents are classified by these structural differences into:
        * Ionic\
    Ionic substances are strong acids and are water soluble due to ionisation. They are further divided into:
            * Monomers\
        Typically high molecular weight.
            * Dimers
        * Non-Ionic\
        Water soluble due to hydrophilic side chains. Lower molecular weight than ionic contrast agents.
            * Monomer\
            Agent of choice for angiography.
                * Easy to inject
                * Water soluble at physiologic pH
            * Dimer\
            Harder to inject than monomers due to higher viscosity. Typically used for urography.
    * All are renally eliminated, and may be retained in renal dysfunction
* **Gadolinium Contrast**\
Gd^3+^, due to its seven unpaired electrons, is paramagnetic and will alters the magnetic field of an MRI machine.
    * Free gadolinium is nephrotoxic and must be chelated
    * This increases its solubility and allows it to be renally eliminated
    * Gadolinium also attenuates x-rays, but is not used as x-ray contrast as doses required would be toxic

## Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions to low-osmolarity agents are uncommon (3%), with severe reactions being very rare (0.04%) and fatal reactions being extremely rare (1:170,000).

### General Adverse Reactions

Adverse reactions include:

* Chemotoxicity
    * Platelet inhibition
    * Increased vagal tone
        * Negative inotropy
        * Negative chronotropy
* Ionic toxicity
    * Cellular membrane dysfunction\
    May worsen myasthenia gravis.
* Osmotoxicity
    * Pain
    * Emesis
    * Increased PAP
    * Decreased PVR
* Hypersensitivity reaction\
Typically occur within 20 minutes of injection.
  \
Risk factors include:

* Asthma or atopy
* Critically ill
* Cardiac disease
* Renal disease

### Contrast Nephropathy

Defined as an increase in creatinine by 25% above baseline within three days of IV contrast administration.\
* It is theorised that osmotic stress and direct tubular toxic effects lead to renal tubular injury, and may cause acute tubular necrosis
* Typically is benign, with creatinine returning to baseline within 10-14 days
* Significant uncertainty as to whether contrast media do cause acute kidney injury\
IF this risk is present, it is probably only relevant in patients who have:
    * Impaired renal function
    * Arterial contrast
* Rehydration and volume correction are effective in preventing a rise in creatinine
