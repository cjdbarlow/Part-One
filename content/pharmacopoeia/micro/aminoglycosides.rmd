# Aminoglycosides


Bactericidal antimicrobials that prevent protein synthesis by irreversible binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit, preventing mRNA transcription.

* As they are large, polar molecules, they must be actively transported into the cell
    * This occurs with an oxygen dependent transporter\
    Therefore they are **not effective against anaerobes**.
* Transport is inhibited by increased Ca^2+^, Mg^2+^, low pH, and low O~2~
* Aminoglycoside killing is dependent on the peak concentration over MIC\
Typically peak concentration must be 8-10x MIC.
    * Exposure to aminoglycosides causes bacteria to down-regulate aminoglycoside uptake, and therefore increases MIC\
    This effect disappears after ~24 hours, and is one justification for daily dosing of aminoglycosides. Additional justifications include:
        * Allows larger single doses to be used, increasing bactericidal effect
        * Aminoglycosides exhibit a post-antibiotic effect\
        Ongoing bactericidal activity even after concentration falls.


|Property|Gentamicin
|--|--|
|**Uses/Spectrum**|Gram negative including pseudomonas, limited gram positive (staph, limited strep), synergistic effects with Î²-lactams and vancomycin.
|**Route of Administration**|IV only.
|**Dosing**|4-7mg.kg^-1^.
|**Distribution**|70% protein bound. Very small V~D~ of 0.2L.kg^-1^, which may result in significant pharmacokinetic changes with oedema.
|**Metabolism**|Not metabolised.
|**Elimination**|Eliminated unchanged, elimination t~1/2~ prolonged up to 70 hours in renal impairment.
|**CNS**|Ototoxicity due to accumulation in perilymph, and is usually permanent. Increased risk with concomitant frusemide use.
|**MSK**| Muscle weakness.
|**Renal**|Nephrotoxicity due to accumulation in the renal cortex, typically reversible.
|**Toxic Effects**|Narrow therapeutic index, requires monitoring and dose reduction in renal impairment.
