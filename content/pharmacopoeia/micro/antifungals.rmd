# Antifungals


Antimicrobial agents targeting eukaryotic and heterotrophic microbes. Can be divided by class into:

* Azoles\
Inhibit ergosterol synthesis.
Subdivided into:
	* Triazoles
		* Fluconazole
		* Itraconazole
		* Voriconazole
		* Posaconazole
	* Imidazoles
		* Ketoconazole
* Echinocandins\
Inhibit glucan synthesis.
	* Caspofungin
	* Micafungin
	* Anidulafungin
* Polyenes\
Disrupt cell membrane.
	* Amphotericin B
	* Nystatin

## Common Features


### Mechanisms of Antifungal Resistance

Three broad mechanisms:

* Increased efflux\
Increased expression of transport proteins removing drug from cell.
* Alteration of target enzyme\
Changes to protein target prevent drug binding or inactivation.
	* Typically only requires changes in a few amino acids
* Alteration of drug metabolism\
Reduced enzyme activity prevents accumulation of toxic product.


Amphotericin resistance is rare *in vivo*, and is typically via different mechanisms:

* Decreased ergosterol content
* Altered sterol:phospholipid ratio

## Comparison of Antifungals


|Drug|Fluconazole|Voriconazole|Caspofungin|Amphotericin B|
|--|--|
|Class|Azole|AzoleEchinocandins|Polyenes|
|Spectrum of Activity|*Candida albicans* (most other species, especially *C. glabrata*and to a lesser extent *C. krusei* are **resistant**), as resistance rapidly develops), *cryptococcus*, *coccidioides*, *histoplasma*, *blastomyces*, and some *aspergillus* (resistance may also develop rapidly). At least as good as amphotericin in susceptible organisms.|As fluconazole, but broader spectrum of activity|*Candida* (including azole resistant *C. glabrata* and *C. krusei* and *Candida* biofilms), *aspergillus*. Notably **no** activity against *cryptococcus*, *fusarium*, and *trichosporon*. <br><br> Additionally, echinocandins typically have no cross-resistance with other antifungals|Effective against many fungi, with **notable exceptions** being *Chromoblastomycosis*, *Aspergillus terreus*, *Candida lusitaniae*, *Scedosporium*, and some *Fusarium*.
|Pharmaceutics|Poor water solubility|Poor water solubility|Poor water solubility|Four different formulations, most common is amphotericin B colloidal dispersion (ABCD)
|Dosing|100-800mg OD, adjust in renal failure||Typically 70mg loading dose, followed by 50mg daily; dose reduced in hepatic impairment|Load with 0.25-0.5kg.kg^-1^, followed by 0.25-1.5mg.day^-1^, reduced in severe renal impairment
|Route of Administration|IV or PO||IV only (high MW)|IV for systemic indications|
|Absorption|High PO bioavailability, PO absorption at low pH (interaction with antacids, vitamin supplements)||<5% PO bioavailability|
|Distribution|Crosses BBB - good CSF penetration. Very low protein binding (~10%)|Not dialysable due to very high protein binding, V~D~. Good tissue penetration.|Essentially no CSF penetration, 97% protein bound in serum|Rapid uptake by reticuloendothelial system. Binds to organic anion transporting peptides (important in hepatocyte drug binding), important in key drug interactions (such as tacrolimus)
|Metabolism|Metabolised by and cause reversible inhibition of multiple hepatic CYP450 enzymes (including 3A4, 2C19, 2C9), leading to increased concentrations of many drugs/metabolites|As fluconazole|Extensive hydrolysis and N-acetylation to inactive metabolites|Minimal metabolism|
|Elimination|80% of fluconazole renally eliminated unchanged|Mostly cleared via liver.|Renal of metabolites|Renal and faecal elimination of unchanged drug
|Mechanism of Action|Inhibit ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450 enzyme|As fluconazole|Prevent cell wall synthesis by blocking production of beta-glucan|Binds sterols, disrupting osmotic integrity of the cell membrane|
|CVS|HTN|Long QT|Histamine release||
|CNS|Headache, visual disturbances|Hallucinations, psychosis|||
|Renal||||AKI via afferent arteriolar constriction and direct tubular toxicity, hypokalaemia, renal tubular acidosis
|GIT|Hepatotoxicity||Mild hepatotoxicity in up to ~15%||
|Haeme||||Thrombophlebitis, normocytic anaemia
