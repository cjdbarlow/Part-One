# Metronidazole


Metronidazole interrupts cellular metabolism by **preferential reduction**, capturing electrons that would be usually transferred to other molecules. This leads to a build up of cytotoxic intermediate metabolic compounds and free radicals, that result in DNA breakage and subsequent cell death.
