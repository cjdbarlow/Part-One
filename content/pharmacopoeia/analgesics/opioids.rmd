# Opioids


## Common Features

|Property|Effect
|--|--|
|**Uses**|Analgesia, sedation, elimination of sympathetic response to laryngoscopy/surgical stress response|
|**Resp**|↓ CNS sensitivity to CO~2~ causing respiratory depression (↓ RR > ↓ V~T~) - ↑ reliance on hypoxic drive (therefore respiratory depression may be potentiated by high FiO~2~)|
|**CVS**|↓ HR. May ↓ BP due to histamine release (less with synthetic agents). ↑ PVR|
|**CNS**|Sedation, euphoria. Nausea and vomiting due to CTZ stimulation. Meiosis due to stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus. ↓ MAC up to 90%|
|**Renal**|↑ ADH, ↑ ureteric and sphincter tone
|**MSK**|Muscle rigidity, pruritus (especially with intrathecal administration)
|**Metabolic**|↓ ACTH, prolactin, gonadotrophic hormone secretion. ↑ ADH secretion|
|**GIT**|↓ Peristalsis and GIT secretions with subsequent constipation|
|**Immunological**|Impaired: chemotaxis, lymphocyte proliferation, and antibody production|

## Comparison of Naturally Occurring Opioids


|Property|Morphine|
|--|--|
|**Receptor**|MOP, KOP|
|**Route of Administration**|SC/IM/IV/Intrathecal|
|**pKa**|8.0, 23% unionised at physiologic pH.|
|**Absorption**|Low (relative) lipid solubility - slower onset and SC absorption. PO preparations absorbed in small bowel, bioavailability 30% - high first pass metabolism.|
|**Distribution**|~35% protein binding. V~D~ 3.5L.kg^-1^|
|**Clearance** (ml.kg^-1^.min^-1^)|15
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic glucuronidation to 70% inactive morphine-3-glucuronide and 10% active morphine-6-glucuronide, which is 13x as potent as morphine. t~1/2~β of 160 minutes.|
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of active metabolites - accumulation in renal failure
|**Time to Peak Effect (IV)**|10-30 minutes|
|**Duration (IV)**|3-4 hours|
|**Equianalgesic Dose** (IV, to 10mg IV morphine)| 10mg|

## Comparison of Semisynthetic Opioids

|Property|Oxycodone|Buprenorphine
|--|--|
|**Receptor**|MOP, KOP, DOP|Partial MOP agonist, KOP antagonist (antanalgesic effect)
|**Route of Administration**|PO/IV|Topical
|**pKa**|8.5, < 10% is unionised at physiologic pH.||
|**Absorption**|PO bioavailability 60-80%|Significant 1st pass metabolism|
|**Distribution**|As lipid soluble as morphine, 45% protein bound, V~D~ 3L.kg^-1^. More rapid onset than morphine despite higher pKa potentially due to active CNS uptake|
|**Clearance** (ml.kg^-1^.min^-1^)|13||
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic demethylation to noroxycodone (80%, via CYP3A) and the more potent and active oxymorphone (20%, via CYP2D6). t~1/2~β 200 minutes.| Hepatic to active norbuprenorphine|
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of active drug and metabolites|70% biliary, 30% renal elimination, t~1/2~β 40 hours|
|**Time to Peak Effect (IV)**|5 minutes||
|**Duration (IV)**|4 hours||
|**Equianalgesic Dose** (IV, to 10mg IV morphine)| 10mg. Note 10mg PO oxycodone is ≈ 15mg PO morphine due to higher first pass metabolism of morphine||


## Comparison of Synthetic Opioids

|Property|Fentanyl|Alfentanil|Remifentanil|
|--|--|
|**Receptor**|MOP|MOP|MOP|
|**Route of Administration**|SC/IM/IV/Epidural/Intrathecal/Transdermal|IV|IV (contains glycine, so cannot be administered intrathecally)|
|**pKa**|8.4, < 10% unionised at pH 7.4|6.5, 90% unionised at pH 7.4 conferring rapid onset|7.3 means 58% unionised at physiologic pH.|
|**Absorption**|Rapid onset of action (< 30s, peak at 5min) due to lipid solubility (600x that of morphine).|90x more lipid soluble than morphine, but more rapid onset than fentanyl. This is due to: <br>1. Low pKa means a greater proportion is unionised at physiological pH. <br> 2. Lower potency of alfentanil compared to fentanyl means a greater dose is required (Bowman's Principle)|20x more lipid soluble than morphine.|
|**Distribution**|600x as lipid soluble as morphine conferring a larger V~D~ (4L.kg^-1^). 85% protein bound.|90x as lipid soluble as morphine, small V~D~ of 0.6L.kg^-1^. 90% protein bound|20x as lipid soluble as morphine, very small V~D~ of 0.4L.kg^-1^. 70% protein bound. CSHT is constant due to rapid metabolism. |
|**Clearance** (ml.kg^-1^.min^-1^)|13|6|40|
|**Metabolism**|Significant first pass pulmonary endothelial uptake. Hepatic demethylation to inactive norfentanyl. t~1/2~β of 190 minutes, longer than morphine due to higher lipid solubility and V~D~.|Shorter elimination t~1/2~β than fentanyl (100 minutes) despite lower clearance due to lower V~D~. Prolonged with administration of midazolam due to CYP3A3/4 competition. |Rapid metabolism by plasma and tissue esterases - t~1/2~β 10 minutes|
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites|Renal elimination of metabolites|Renal of inactive metabolites|
|**Time to Peak Effect (IV)**|5 minutes|90 seconds|1-3 minutes|
|**Duration (IV)**|Variable depending on dose and distribution. With doses > 3μg.kg^-1^ tissues become saturated and the duration of action is significantly prolonged|5-10 minutes|Offset 5-10 minutes from ceasing infusion|
|**Equianalgesic Dose** (IV, to 10mg IV morphine)|150mcg|1mg|50mcg|
