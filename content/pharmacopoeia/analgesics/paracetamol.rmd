# Paracetamol


Paracetamol an analgesic and antipyretic which is typically classed as an NSAID, though it is unique and important enough to get its own page. It has a number of mechanisms of action:

* **Non-selective COX inhibition**, including COX-3\
  This confers some of the analgesic properties
* **Inhibition of central prostaglandin synthesis**\
  This confers the antipyretic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin E synthesis in the anterior hypothalamus in response to pyrogens
* **Serotonergic inhibition**\
  Provides some additional analgesic action
* **Cannabinoid inhibition**\
  Provides some additional analgesic action via endocannabinoid reuptake inhibition.

|Property|Effect|
|--|--|
|**Class**|NSAID, acetanilide derivative
|**Uses**|Analgesia, antipyretic
|**Presentation**| Tablets, capsules, syrup, clear colourless solution for IV administration
|**Route of Administration**|PO/PR/IV
|**Dosing**|10-15mg.kg^-1^ Q4H up to 90mg.kg^-1^.day^-1^
|**Onset**|IV: 5 mins, peak at 40 mins <br> PO/PR: 40 mins, peak at 1 hour
|**Absorption**|Rapid absorption (via small bowel, therefore proportional to gastric emptying), variable bioavailability (up to 90%) - greater by PR route
|**Distribution**|10% protein bound, small V~D~: 0.5-1L.kg^-1^ (though larger than other NSAIDs)
|**Metabolism**|Predominantly hepatic glucuronidation. However, 10% is metabolised to NAPQI by CYP2E1 which is hepatotoxic.
|**Elimination**|Active secretion into renal tubules - consider dose reduction in renal impairment
|**Resp**|May exacerbate analgesic asthma due to glutathione depletion
|**CNS**|Excellent analgesia. Synergistic with other analgesics, resulting in agent-sparing effect and reduced side effects
|**Metabolic**|Antipyretic
|**Haeme**|Cytopaenias (rare)

## Toxicity

* Paracetamol is partially metabolised to the toxic N-acetyl-p-amino-benzoquinone imine (**NAPQI**)
  * In normal circumstances this rapidly conjugated with glutathione
  * In toxicity,  glutathione is exhausted
  * NAPQI then covalently binds to critical proteins in hepatocytes, causing centrilobular hepatic necrosis and cell death
\
\
  * Toxic doses:
    * **>200mg.kg^-1^** in a single ingestion
    * Repeated ingestion of >150mg.kg^-1^.day^-1^ for two days
    * \>100mg.kg^-1^.day^-1^ for three days

* Risk factors for toxicity:
  * Glutathione deficiency
    * Extremes of age
    * Malnutrition
    * Hepatic dysfunction
  * Enzyme inducers:
    * Anti-epileptics
      * Carbamazepine
      * Phenytoin
      * Phenobarbitone
    * Rifampicin
    * ETOH
    * OCP

### Features of Overdose

* Conscious
* Nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain
* Haemolytic anaemia
* Distributive shock
* Hyperglycaemia
* Late (>48 hours) hepatic failure
* Later (3-5 days) coagulopathy
* Fulminant hepatic failure (3-7 days)

### Treatment of Overdose

* Activated charcoal with tablet ingestion if seen within 1 hour of ingestion.


* Serum paracetamol level to determine requirement for NAC (N-acetylcysteine) based on the nomogram
  * IV NAC is used as it is a glutathione precursor, replenishing depleted glutathione and facilitating further conjugation of NAPQI
