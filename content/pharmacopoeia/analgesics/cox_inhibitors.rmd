# COX Inhibitors


Cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors are typically **used** to treat **mild to moderate pain**. Oral COX inhibitors typically have:

* **Rapid absorption**
* **High protein binding**
* **Low V~D~**

## Mechanism of Action


There are two(ish) **isoenzymes** of COX:

* **COX-1**\
Important for homeostatic function. 
* **COX-2**\
**Induced** with tissue damage and contributes to inflammation. COX-2:
  * Exists in the vascular endothelium where it synthesises prostacyclin (which opposes the action of thromboxanes)
  * Inhibition may result in a relative abundance of thromboxane, causing platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction
* **COX-3**\
Variant of COX-1 which exists centrally and mediates the analgesic and antipyretic effects of paracetamol.
 
Effects occur due to:

* Decrease in endoperoxidases\
Inhibited by COX.
* Increase in other arachidonic-acid derived factors\
Due to the diversion of arachidonic acid down other pathways.

COX inhibition has different effects in different tissues:

* Prevents subsequent conversion of prostaglandins to thromboxane A~2~ and PGI~2~\
* Peripherally, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is anti-inflammatory
* Centrally, it is anti-pyretic
* In the stomach, it decreases mucous production and leads to mucosal ulceration


* Aspirin (a non-specific COX inhibitor), prevents production of both thromboxane A~2~ and PGI~2~
  * As platelets **have no nucleus**, the COX inhibition remains for the entirety of the platelet lifespan
  * Endothelial cells will produce new COX within hours, and so its anti-inflammatory effects are temporary


### Adverse Effects

* **Asthma/Bronchospasm**\
Secondary to increased leukotriene synthesis due to increased arachidonic acid levels. Occurs in 20% of asthmatics with NSAID use.

* **Platelet dysfunction**\
A consequence of COX-1 inhibition only, and may result in increased perioperative bleeding risk (though decreased AMI and CVA risk).

* **Thrombotic events**, including MI and CVA\
Risk is greater with **COX-2** inhibitors, due to **selective inhibition of prostacyclin**. with NNH for non-fatal MI being 500 patient-years, and NNH for fatal MI being 1000 patient-years.

* **Impaired GFR**\
Occurs as a consequence of uninhibited afferent arteriolar constriction. Worse with concurrent hypovolaemia, renal artery stenosis, or concurrent ACE-I use.

* **Gastric erosion**\
A consequence of impaired mucosal secretion through COX-1 inhibition. This can result in pain, anaemia, or fatal bleed. In general, risk of gastric erosion is (from highest to lowest risk):
  * Ketorolac
  * Diclofenac/naproxen
  * Ibuprofen (<1.2g/day)
  * COX-2 Inhibitors


* **Transaminitis** may occur following NSAID use

## Comparison of COX Inhibitors

| Characteristic | Aspirin| Diclofenac | Ketorolac|Ibuprofen|Celecoxib|Parecoxib|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|**Mechanism of Action**| Irreversible inhibition of platelet thromboxane production. As platelets are anucleate, they are unable to regenerate thromboxane.|Non-selective COX inhibitor|Non-selective COX inhibition|Non-selective COX-inhibition|COX-2 inhibitor (30:1 in favour of COX-2)|COX-2 inhibitor (61:1 in favour of COX-2)|
|**Uses**|Prevention of arterial thromboembolism, MI, CVA, migraine, analgesia, others (e.g. Still's disease)| Mild-to-moderate pain|Potent anti-analgesic, minimal anti-inflammatory properties|Mild-to-moderate pain| Analgesia, particular chronic arthritic pain|Acute inflammatory pain|
|**Distribution**| 85% protein bound. Weak acid with a pKa of 3, unionised in the stomach and ionised at physiological pH||||97% protein bound||
|**Absorption**|Gastric absorption (pKa 3) leads to rapid onset.||||||
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic metabolism to salicyluric acid and glucuronides. May have zero-order elimination in overdose.|||CYP to inactive metabolites |CYP2C9 to inactive metabolites|CYP2C9 to inactive metabolites|
|**Elimination**|Renal. Elimination may be increased with urinary alkalinisation.|||||||
|**Dose**| Low-dose (100mg daily) selectively inhibits platelet COX, whilst preserving endothelial COX, resulting in decreased platelet aggregation whilst maintaining vasodilation. 300-900mg for analgesia/migraine.| 50mg BD/TDS|15-30mg IM/IV Q6H|400-800mg TDS, or 10mg/kg| 100-200mg BD|20-40mg BD|
|**Route**| PO| PO/PR/IM/IV| IM/IV (off-label in Australia)|PO/PR|PO|IV|
|**Respiratory**| Aspirin uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, increasing O~2~ consumption and CO~2~ production. It also may stimulate, and (at higher doses) depress the respiratory centre. In overdose, these are significant, and may result in a **mixed** respiratory and metabolic **acidosis**.||||||
|**CVS**| MI and CVA risk reduction. Increased bleeding.|Risk of MI similar to COX-2 inhibitors. Local thrombus with IV injection.| |Lower dose not associated with prothrombotic events.|Unclear effect on CVA and MI, but recommended to avoid use in IHD/CVD|Unclear effect on CVA and MI, but recommended to avoid use in IHD/CVD|
|**Metabolic**| **Reye's syndrome** is mitochondrial damage, hepatic failure, and cerebral oedema (and encephalopathy) in children <12. Mortality 40%.|||||||
