# Depolarising NMBs


Succinylcholine binds to the nicotinic ACh receptor causing depolarisation. It cannot be hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase in the NMJ, and so remains bound to the receptor. This:

* Produces a sustained depolarisation which keeps voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive state
* Prevents the post-junctional membrane from responding to further ACh release


|Property|Succinylcholine
|--|--|
|**Class**|Depolarising muscle relaxant.
|**Uses**|Facilitate tracheal intubation.
|**Presentation**|Colourless solution of pH 3, at 50mg.ml^-1^. Structurally, it is two ACh groups joined at the acetyl groups.
|**Route of Administration**|IV, IM.
|**Dosing**|1-2mg.kg^-1^ IV, 3-4mg.kg^-1^ IM up to 150mg.
|**Onset and Duration**|IV onset in 30s to 1 minute, lasting 2-3 minutes, with offset typically within 10 minutes. Offset occurs due to dissociation of drug out of NMJ into plasma, as a concentration gradient is established by drug breakdown in plasma. Prolonged duration in patients with **pseudocholinesterase deficiency**. IM onset in 2-3 minutes.
|**Distribution**|30% protein bound. Nil distribution due to rapid metabolism - V~D~ 0.25L.kg^-1^. Crosses placenta in very small amounts.
|**Metabolism**|Rapid hydrolysis by plasma cholinesterases such that only **20%** of administered dose reaches the NMJ.
|**Elimination**|Minimal renal elimination due to rapid metabolism.
|**Resp**|Apnoea, and **suxamethonium apnoea**. May cause **masseter spasm**. ↑ Salivation due to muscarinic effects.
|**CVS**|Arrhythmia due to SA node stimulation, as well as secondary to hyperkalaemia. Bradycardia (due to muscarinic effects with second/large doses, or in children).
|**CNS**|↑ ICP (due to contraction), ↑ IOP (by 10mmHg - this is **significant**) such that it is contraindicated in globe perforation.
|**Metabolic**|**Malignant Hyperthermia**.
|**MSK**|Myalgias post depolarisation, particularly in young females. Prolonged blockade with pseudocholinesterase deficiency.
|**Renal and Electrolyte**|Hyperkalaemia (K^+^ ↑ by ~0.5mmol.L^-1^) due to depolarisation causing K^+^ efflux, ↑ in burns (>10%), paraplegia (first 6 months) and neuromuscular disorders including muscular dystrophy and myopathies (including **critical illness myopathy**).
|**GIT**|Intragastric pressure ↑ by 10cmH~2~O, matched by ↑ in LoS pressure.
|**Immunological**|Anaphylaxis - highest risk of all NMBs at ~11/100,000

## Adverse Effects

The adverse effects of suxamethonium can be remembered as **three major, three minor, and three pressures**:
  * **Major**
    * Anaphylaxis
    * Suxamethonium Apnoea
    * Malignant hyperthermia
  * **Minor**
    * Hyperkalaemia
    * Myalgias
    * Bradycardia
  * **Pressure**
    * IOP
    * ICP
    * Intragastric pressure

## Phase I and Phase II Blockade

Initial blockade is termed **Phase I**, which is a partial depolarising block. Sustained use of suxamethonium may causes a Phase II block which:

* Appears similar to a non-depolarising block
* May be due to:
  * Presynaptic inhibition of ACh synthesis and release
  * Desensitisation of the post-junctional receptor

Key differences include:

|Property|Phase I Block|Phase II Block
|--|--|--|
|**Block Amplitude**|Reduced|Reduced|
|**Train-of-four ratio**| >0.7|< 0.7
|**Post-tetanic potentiation**|No|Yes
|**Effect of anticholinesterases**|Block augmented|Block inhibited

## Malignant Hyperthermia

* Rare autosomal dominant genetic condition
* Triggered by suxamethonium and volatile anaesthetic agents
* Mutation of the ryanodine receptor causes excessive amounts of calcium to leave the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing continual muscle contraction
  * Results in greatly increased carbon dioxide, lactate, and heat production
  * Cell lysis with myoglobulinaemia and hyperkalaemia results

## Suxamethonium Apnoea

* A deficiency of butylcholinesterase causes suxamethonium to not be metabolised
* May be congenital (genetic) or acquired (hepatic failure)
* Can be treated with fresh frozen plasma
