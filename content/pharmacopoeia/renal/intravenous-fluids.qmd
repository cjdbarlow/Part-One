# Intravenous Fluids


Intravenous fluids can be classified into:

* **Crystalloids**\
Can pass freely through a semipermeable membrane. Can be further classified into:
    * ECF replacement solutions\
    Have a [Na^+^] similar to ECF, such that they are confined mostly to the ECF.
    * Maintenance solutions\
    Designed to distribute throughout TBW.
    * Special solutions\
    These solutions don't fit into the above two categories, and include:
        * Hypertonic saline
        * Mannitol
        * 8.4% Sodium Bicarbonate
* **Colloids**\
Substance evenly dispersed throughout another solution in which it is insoluble. Can be classified into:
    * Naturally occurring
        * Albumin\
        Heat-treated human albumin.
            * Produced at low pH but not technically sterile\
            Use within 3 hours of opening.
            * Contributes to plasma oncotic pressure
            * Contributes to drug and endogenous substance binding
    * Synthetic
        * Dextrans\
        High molecular weight sugars synthesised from sucrose by bacteria.\
            * Interfere with haemostasis due to vWF inhibition
            * Interfere with blood crossmatch
            * Risk of anaphylaxis
        * Gelatins\
        High molecular weight proteins produced by collagen hydrolysis.
            * Greatest anaphylaxis risk
            * Do not interfere with clotting
        * Hydroxyl-ethyl starches
            * Risk of anaphylaxis
            * Risk of renal impairment
            * Accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system
