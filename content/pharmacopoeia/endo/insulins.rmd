# Insulins


Insulins are synthetic polypeptide hormones. They:

* Have a similar mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics of endogenous insulin
* One unit of insulin is defined as the amount required to make a previously healthy 2kg rabbit hypoglycaemic

## Types of Insulin

Different insulins are categorised by their time of **onset**, **peak**, and **duration**, and are classified as either:

* Fast acting
* Intermediate acting
* Long acting

### Fast Acting

Fast acting insulins are used for controlling BSL spikes post meals, and for control of hyperglycaemia. Administered subcutaneously they have have an:

* Onset of 5-15 minutes
* Peak at 1-2 hours
* Last 4-6 hours.

Fast acting insulins include:

* Insulin Aspart (Novorapid)
* Insulin Lispro (Humalog)

### Intermediate Acting

Intermediate acting insulins are used for control of BSL between meals as a pseudo-basal bolus. Administered subcutaneously they have an:

* Onset of 1-2 hours
* Peak at 4-6 hours
* Last >12 hours

Intermediate acting insulins include:

* NPH
* Protophane

### Long Acting

Long acting insulins are used for creating a baseline insulin level. Administered subcutaneously they have an:

* Onset of 1-1.5 hours
* Peak at 5 hours
* Last 24 hours

Long-acting insulins include:

* Insulin glargine (Lantus)
* Insulin detemir (Levemir)

## Pharmacokinetics of Exogenous Insulin Preparations

|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Class**|Synthetic polypeptide hormones
|**Uses**| Diabetes, hyperglycaemia, hyperkalaemia, Î²-blocker toxicity, Ca^2+^-blocker toxicity
|**Presentation**| Clear colourless solution typically at 100 IU.ml^-1^
|**Route of Administration**|SC, IM, IV
|**Absorption**| Variable, as described above. Insulin is complexed with different substances (e.g. protamine, zinc), which alter its rate of absorption
|**Distribution**| Minimal protein binding and minimal redistribution out of ECF - V~D~ 0.075L.kg^-1^
|**Metabolism**| Glutathione insulin transhydrogenase. Metabolism is constant - duration of action is entirely due to different rates of subcutaneous absorption.
|**Elimination**| Renal of inactive metabolites
