# Local Anaesthetics

> Understanding of the pharmacology of local anaesthetic drugs, including their toxicity

Local anaesthetic drugs create a use-dependent temporary blockade of neuronal transmission by blocking the voltage-gated sodium channel in the cell membrane, preventing depolarisation. 

## Mechanism of Action

Action is dependent on blockade of the sodium channel. Two theories exist:

* **Unionised** drug **passes through the cell membrane**, and then becomes **ionised intracellularly**
* The ionised drug is then able to bind to the **open **sodium channel, and prevent conduction of sodium and therefore generation of an action potential
  * Local anaesthetics also display reduced affinity for K^+^ and L-type Ca^2+^ channels
  * This theory explains use-dependent blockade, as sodium channels can only be blocked in their open state
\
\
* An alternative suggested mechanism of action is the drug enters the cell membrane and mechanically distorts the channel, rendering it ineffective


* Onset is inversely proportional to the size of the fibre\
From fastest to slowest:
  * Pain
  * Temperature
  * Touch
  * Deep pressure
  * Motor

## Chemical Structure of Local Anaesthetics

All local anaesthetics are weak bases consisting of:

* A hydrophilic component
* A lipophilic aromatic ring
* An amide or ester link connecting the two

Chemical structure influences pharmacological behaviour:

* Hydrophilic portion\
Typically the tertiary amine.
  * Determines ionisation
    * 3 bonds: Lipid soluble
    * 4 bonds: Water soluble
* Lipophilic portion\
Typically aromatic ring.
  * Determines lipid solubility, and therefore potency, toxicity, and duration of action
* Ester vs. amide
  * Amides
    * Hepatically metabolised (hydroxylation and N-de-alkylation)\
    This is slower, therefore there is a **greater risk** of systemic toxicity.
    * Stable in solution
  * Esters
    * Heat-sensitive\
    Cannot be autoclaved.
    * Rapidly hydrolysed in plasma\
    Organ independent elimination.
    * Have a greater incidence of allergy\
    Due to the inactive metabolite PABA.
* Amine group length
  * Potency and toxicity increase as carbon-chain increases
  * Toxicity (but not potency) continues to increase beyond 10 carbons
* Isomerism\
Alters behaviour:
  * Levobupivacaine is less toxic
  * R-ropivacaine is less potent and more toxic

## Key Characteristics of Local Anaesthetics

Characteristics are related to chemical structure. These include:

* **Potency**\
  * Potency is expressed with the minimum effective concentration of local anaesthetic (C~m~)\
  This is the concentration of LA that results in complete block of a nerve fibre in 50% of subjects in standard conditions. More potent agents have a lower C~m~.
  * Potency is a function of:
    * Lipid solubility\
    Potency (and also toxicity) increases with greater lipid solubility.
    * Vasodilator properties\
    In general, local anaesthetics cause vasodilation in low concentrations, and vasoconstriction at high concentrations (except cocaine, which causes vasoconstriction at all concentrations).
* **Duration of action**\
Duration of action is a function of:
  * Drug factors
    * Vasodilator properties\
    Vasoconstriction increases the duration of block.
    * Use of additives\
    Addition of adrenaline to lignocaine increases duration of block.
    * Lipid solubility\
    Increased lipid solubility increases duration of action, as agent remains in the nerve for longer.
      * Potency therefore has a positive correlation with duration of action
      * Duration of action is increased when pH increases, as the ionised portion falls\
    * Protein binding\
    Highly protein bound agents have an increased duration of action due to increased tissue binding.
      * Protein binding decreases with decreasing pH, increasing the fraction of unbound drug\
      This is why agents such as bupivacaine are more cardiotoxic in acidotic patients.
      * Local anaesthetics are predominantly bound to α-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG)\
      AAG is reduced in pregnancy, increasing the free drug fraction and therefore reducing the toxic dose of LA in pregnant patients.
  * Patient factors
    * Tissue pH\
    Decreased duration of block when tissue pH is low.
    * Metabolic impairment
      * Hepatic failure increases duration of action of aminosteroids
      * Butylcholinesterase deficiency increases duration of ester local anaesthetics
    * Site of administration
    Well vascularised tissue (e.g. intercostal area) will have greater systemic uptake of drug than vessel poor tissue.
* **Onset**\
Speed of onset is related to:
  * Drug factors
    * Dose\
    Increasing the dose increases the speed of onset, as per Fick's Law.
      * Increased concentration will increase speed of onset and block density
      * Increased volume (without increasing dose, resulting in decreased concentration) will decrease speed of onset
    * Lipid solubility\
    An increased lipid solubility increases the speed at which the local anaesthetic enters the nerve. **However**:
      * Lipid solubility also correlates with potency
      * Therefore, **in practice**, more lipid soluble agents are administered in lower doses, and so have a **reduced speed of onset**\
      This is known as Bowman's Principle.
    * Ionised portion\
    Only unionised drug can cross cell membranes. Ionisation is a function of:
      * pKa
      * Tissue pH
        * This is also why anaesthetics are ineffective in anaesthetising infected tissue, as the low pH makes the majority of the LA ionised and unable to cross the cell membrane.
  * Patient factors
    * Nerve activity\
    Local anaesthetics produce a **frequency dependent blockade**, meaning nerves firing frequently will be blocked more rapidly than quiescent nerves
    * Nerve fibre size\
    Larger nerves require an increased concentration of local anaesthetic to achieve blockade than smaller nerves.
    * Nerve type\
    Different nerve fibres are affected at different speeds, which is mostly (though not entirely) a function of critical length.
      * Aγ (proprioceptive) are affected first
      * Small myelinated Aδ (sharp pain, cold) fibres are affected second
      * Large myelinated nerves are affected third
      These include Aα (motor) and Aβ (touch) fibres.
      * Unmyelinated nerves are affected last\
      These include C (dull pain, heat) fibres.
    * Hyperkalaemia\
    Reduces onset of action.

## Toxicity

Local anaesthetics are:

* Toxic to both the **CNS** and **CVS**
* Toxicity occurs when there is an excess plasma concentration\
This occurs when the rate of drug entering the systemic circulation is greater than the drug leaving the systemic circulation due to redistribution and metabolism.

Toxicity is related to the:

* **Drug factors**
  * **Drug used**\
Agents are compared using the **CC/CNS ratio**, which is the ratio of the dose of drug required to cause cardiovascular collapse (CC) compared to the dose required to cause seizure. It is a crude alternative to the therapeutic index.
  * **Dose used**\
Continuous infusions are more likely to cause a delayed onset of local anaesthetic toxicity.


* **Block factors**
  * **Site** of administration\
  This affects the rate of uptake into the systemic circulation, and the likelihood of inadvertent intravascular injection. Ranked (from highest to lowest):
    * Intravascular (obviously)\
    This is the most common cause of LA toxicity.
      * Site is also relevant here: an injection into the carotid artery will cause toxicity at a lower dose than if injected into a peripheral vein.
    * Intercostal
    * Caudal
    * Epidural
    * Brachial plexus
    * Subcutaneous
  * Use of **adjuncts**
    * Adrenaline\
    Vasoconstrictor properties reduce systemic absorption of LA.
  * **Technique**\
    * Frequent aspiration
    * Test dose
    * Use of ultrasound


* **Patient factors**\
Anything that increases peak [plasma] can lead to an increased risk of LA toxicity.
  * Blood flow to affected area
  * α1-acid glycoprotein\
  Low levels of this protein increase free drug fraction.\
    * Neonates and infants have half the level of AAG than adults.
  * Hepatic disease\
  Reduces clearance of amides, which may cause toxicity with repeated doses or use of infusions.
  * Age\
  Organ blood flow (and therefore clearance), as well as pharmacokinetic interactions may affect clearance of LA. Both **children and the elderly** have **reduced clearance** of LA.
  * Acidosis\
  Increases unionised portion.
  * Hypercarbia\
  Increases cerebral blood flow.

### Cardiac Toxicity

Cardiac toxicity occurs due to:

* Blocking of the cardiac Na^+^ channel (K^+^ and Ca^2+^ channels may also be involved)\
Severity of toxicity will vary depending on how long the agent binds to the channel, with **less toxicity** caused by agents spending **less time bound**:
  * Lignocaine\
  Spends the shortest time bound to the channel, so causes the least amount of toxicity. This is also why lignocaine can be used as an antiarrhythmic, but other agents can not.
  * Bupivacaine\
  Takes **10x as long** to dissociate as lignocaine. This can lead to re-entrant arrhythmias, and then VF. The **risk **of this is **increased in tachycardia** due to use-dependent blockade.
  * Ropivacaine\
  Dissociates more rapidly from cardiac channels than bupivacaine.
* Direct myocardial depressant effects\
Reduces cAMP levels by disrupting metabotropic receptors.

**Cardiac **toxicity is **triphasic**:

* Initial phase
  * Hypertension
  * Tachycardia
* Intermediate phase:
  * Hypotension
  * Myocardial depression
* Terminal phase:
  * Severe hypotension
  * Vasodilation
  * Various arrhythmias\
    * Sinus bradycardia
    * Variable degree heart block
    * VT
    * VF
    * Asystole

### CNS Toxicity

Local anaesthetics in their unionised state can cross the BBB and interfere with CNS conduction. **CNS toxicity is biphasic**:

* Initially, inhibitory interneurons are blocked\
This causes excitatory effects:
  * Perioral tingling
  * Slurred speech
  * Visual disturbances
  * Tremulousness
  * Dizziness
  * Confusion
  * Convulsions\
  Typically signifies the end of the excitatory phase.
* Secondly, there is a general depression of all CNS neurons\
This causes inhibitory effects:
  * Coma
  * Apnoea
  \
### Treatment

Toxicity is managed with an **ABC approach**, though definitive management uses **Intralipid emulsion**:

* Intralipid is an emulsion of soya oil, glycerol, and egg phospholipids.\
Mechanism of action in uncertain, but theories include:
  * Lipid sink\
  ILE binds unionised LA, causing it to distribute off receptor sites.
  * Fatty acid metabolism\
  Cardiac fatty acid metabolism is interrupted by LA. ILE provides a source of fatty acids to allow metabolism to continue.
  * Competitive antagonism\
  ILE may directly inhibit LA binding.
\
\
* Dosing of Intralipid 20%:
    * Bolus of 1.5ml.kg^-1^ over 1 minute
    * Infusion at 15ml.kg^-1^.hr^-1^


* Complications include **pancreatitis**\
Note that ILE interferes with amylase and lipase assays, and so these will be unreliable.
  \
* Note that whilst propofol can be used to treat seizures, the amount of lipid contained in propofol is inadequate to bind LA
