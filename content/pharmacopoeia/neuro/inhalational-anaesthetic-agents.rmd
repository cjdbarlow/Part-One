Inhaled anaesthetics are chemicals with general anaesthetic properties that can be delivered by inhalation. They can be divided into:

* **Volatile** anaesthetic agents\
Volatility refers to the tendency of a liquid to vapourise. Volatile agents include:
    * Sevoflurane
    * Isoflurane
    * Desflurane
    * Methoxyflurane
    * Enflurane
    * Halothane
    * Ether
* Anaesthetic gases
    * Nitrous oxide
    * Xenon
  \
## Key Principles of Inhalational Agents

Key principles:

* The **clinical effect** of an inhalational agent **is dependent on** its **partial pressure** within the CNS
* **At equilibrium**, the partial pressure in the CNS (**P~B~**) **equals** the partial pressure in blood (**P~a~**), and in the alveoli (**P~A~**)\
Reaching equilibrium is rarely achieved in practice as it takes many hours.
* Rate of onset and offset of an inhalational agent are dependent on both physiological and pharmacological factors affecting the transfer of agent:
    * Into the alveoli
    * From the alveoli into blood
    * From blood into the CNS

### Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC)

MAC is **defined** as the minimum alveolar concentration at **steady state** which prevents a movement response to a standard surgical stimulus (1cm forearm incision) in 50% of a population.

Note that this definition:

* Does not reflect lack of awareness\
* Does reflect the action of an agent on spinal cord reflexes\
This is why 1 MAC is adequate for the majority of patients, as awareness and recall are suppressed at lower MAC values than are required for immobility.
* Consciousness is better estimated by MAC-awake\
End-tidal concentration of agent that prevents appropriate responses to a verbal command in 50% of a population.
    * Note that this technically measures *awareness* rather than memory.
    * **MAC-awake** is typically **one-third** of **MAC** for commonly-used agents
* Is only valid at **sea-level**\
The **clinical effect** of an agent is **dependent** on its **partial pressure *not* concentration**.
    * At 1atm, these are almost the same\
    1atm ≃ 100kPa; therefore 2% sevoflurane is ≃ 2kPa
    * As altitude increases, the actual partial pressure will fall for any given concentration
    i.e. 2% sevoflurane at 0.5atm is ≃ 1kPa of sevoflurane.

MAC is:

* A measure of potency (i.e. the EC~50~ of the agent, where the outcome is movement)\
The MAC of an agent is inversely proportional to potency; i.e. more potent agents require smaller alveolar concentrations to produce anaesthesia.
    * This gives rise to the **Meyer-Overton hypothesis**, which suggests that anaesthesia requires a sufficient number of molecules to dissolve into the neuronal cell membrane.
        * If this was true, the product of the oil:gas partition coefficient and MAC would be constant, which is not the case.
* Additive\
The MACs of different agents used simultaneously are additive.
* Normally-distributed\
Not all patients will be unresponsive at 1 MAC.
    * The standard deviation is **0.1**, so 95% of patients will not move in response to a stimulus at 1.2 MAC
* Estimated clinically using **end-tidal** gas measurement\
MAC is not based on arterial partial pressure (F~a~) of agent. 
    * This is an important difference, because **even at steady-state**, <strong>F~a~ ≠ F~A~</strong>\
    * This occurs due to:
        * V/Q mismatch\
        Shunted alveoli will not absorb anaesthetic agent, and unperfused alveoli will contain agent that is not being absorbed.
            * This is worsened by the effects of anaesthesia
        * Volatile agents are heavy and have finite diffusibility
    * However, the difference between F~a~ and F~A~ for any agent is the same at steady state (and in absence of nitrous oxide)\
    This means that, **at steady-state**, MAC will be proportional to, and an accurate measure of, P~a~.
* One of several related terms:
    * MAC awake\
    Concentration required to prevent response to a verbal stimuli in **absence of noxious stimuli**.\
        * Typically ~1/3^rd^ of MAC for most agents (sevoflurane, isoflurane, desflurane)
        * Notably higher for nitrous oxide (MAC-awake ~2/3^rds^ of MAC)
        * MAC-awake is typically less than MAC-asleep as:
            * Hysteresis between alveolar and effect site concentrations\
            During induction, alveolar concentration is higher than effect site concentration, and so overestimates effect. During wash out, alveolar concentration is less than effect site concentration, and the reverse effect occurs.
            * "Neural inertia"\
            Intrinsic resistance of nerve cells to a change in their state.
    * MAC-BAR\
    Minimum alveolar concentration required to **b**lock **a**drenergic **response**, i.e. to prevent a rise in HR or BP following skin incision.
    * MAC~95~\
    The MAC required to prevent a movement response to a standard surgical stimulus in 95% of the population.
    * MAC.hr^-1^\
    The amount of time a patient is exposed to 1 MAC of an agent. Used to compare different agents.

#### Factors Affecting MAC

|Decreases MAC|Increases MAC|
|---|---|
|Age (~6%/10 years ↑) and neonates|Youth
|Hypothermia|Hyperthermia|
|Hypocapnea|Hypercapnea|
|Hyponatraemia|Hypernatraemia|
|Hypothyroidism|Hyperthyroidism|
|Acute alcohol and other CNS depressant intoxication|Chronic ETOH and CNS depressant abuse|
|Chronic amphetamine intake|Acute amphetamine intake|
|Hypovolaemia/Hypotension||
|Lithium||
|Hypoxia||
|Anaemia||
|Pregnancy||
||SNS activation and anxiety
||Increased P~atm~

Note that addition of other agents (e.g. opioids) will affect different MAC subtypes (e.g. MAC~50~ vs MAC~BAR~) differently.

### Partition Coefficients

A **partition coefficient** describes the **relative affinity** of an agent for two phases, and is **defined** as the **ratio of the concentration** of agent in each phase, when both **phases are of equal volume** and the partial pressures are in **equilibrium at STP**.
* The **blood:gas partition coefficient** describes the solubility of the agent in blood relative to air, when the two phases are of equal volume and in equilibrium at STP\
A **low** blood:gas partition coefficient indicates a **rapid** onset and offset. This is because:
    * Poorly soluble agents generate a high P~a~, which creates a steep gradient between P~a~ and P~B~, giving a rapid onset of action
    * Conversely, soluble agents dissolve easily into pulmonary blood without substantially increasing P~a~\
    This causes leads to a slow onset due to:
        * A large fall in P~A~ as the agent leaves the alveolus, decreasing the gradient for further diffusion
        * A small gradient between P~a~ and P~B~<br><br>
* The **oil:gas partition coefficient** describes the solubility of the agent in fat relative to air, when both phases are of equal volume and in equilibrium at STP\
A **high** oil:gas partition coefficient indicates a greater potency, and therefore a low MAC.


## Pharmacokinetics of Inhalational Agents{#pk}

Achieving the required P~B~ requires maintaining P~A~ at a high enough level. By increasing P~A~, the pressure gradient for diffusion into blood, and therefore CNS, is increased.

As discussed above, rate of onset of an inhalational agent is dependent on rate of uptake:

* Into the alveoli
* From the alveoli into blood
* From blood into the CNS


Factors affecting **alveolar concentration of agent:**
* **Inspired concentration**\
    A high inspired concentration (*F*~i~) will increase the rate of increase of alveolar concentration (*F*~A~). Inspired concentration is dependent on:
    * Delivered concentration in fresh gas
    * Fresh gas flow\
    **Increasing FGF** (and the concentration of agent in the added gas) increases *F*~i~.
    * Volume of the breathing system\
    A **lower circuit volume** will increase the rate at which the patient reaches equilibrium with the circuit, and therefore **increase *F*~i~**.
    * Circuit absorption\
    **Absorption of agent** by the circuit will **decrease *F*~i~**.
* **V~A~**\
Increased alveolar ventilation increases *F*~i~, as it replenishes agent that has been taken up into the vasculature.
    * Similarly, increased **dead space** will prolong induction, as anaesthetic gas will be delivered to non-perfused alveoli
* **FRC**\
A **large FRC** will dilute the amount of agent inspired with each breath, and so **reduce *F*~i~**.
    * This is measured with the V~A~/FRC ratio\
    Increased ratio increases speed of onset.
        * Normal in adults: 1.5:1
        * Normal in neonates: 5:1
* **Second gas effect**\
Use of N~2~O with another agent will increase the P~A~ of that agent. This is because:
    * N~2~O is **20x** as soluble in blood as either blood or nitrogen, and is administered in high concentrations, so it is rapidly absorbed from alveoli
    * If nitrous oxide is delivered at high concentrations, it's rapid absorption means that alveoli will **shrink**, causing:
        * An increase in the fractional concentration of all other gases\
        This is known as the **concentration effect**, and increases the pressure gradient driving diffusion into blood, increasing speed of onset.
            * The concentration effect is the cause of the second gas effect
            * The concentration effect is **more pronounced as FiN~2~O increases**
            * The concentration effect is more profound in lung units with moderately **low V/Q ratios**, causing in a large increase in F~a~\
            This results in a larger value of F~a~ for any given F~A~, *even at steady state*.
        * Augmented ventilation as more inhalational agent is drawn in the alveoli from dead space gas
    * The second gas effect also causes **diffusion hypoxia**\
    When inspired N~2~O is reduced, N~2~O will leave blood and enter the alveolus, displacing other gases in the alveolus.
        * This can cause a reduction in PAO~2~, and therefore hypoxaemia
        * Diffusion hypoxia is avoided by delivering 100% oxygen, which maintains an adequate PAO~2~ as N~2~O is removed

<img src="resources/fa-fi.svg">

* Note that N~2~O reaches a higher ratio faster than desflurane, despite its lower blood:gas partition coefficient, due to the concentration effect

Factors affecting **drug uptake from the lungs:**\
* **Blood:gas partition coefficient**\
Agents with a low blood:gas partition coefficient reach $F_A \over F_I$equilibrium more rapidly. The blood:gas coefficient is affected by:
    * Temperature\
    Blood:gas partition coefficients decrease as temperature increases.
    * Haematocrit\
    Variable effect, which depends on the particular agents affinity for red cells or plasma (and serum constituents, e.g. albumin).
        * An agent that is less soluble in red cells (e.g. isoflurane) will have a decreased blood-gas partition coefficient in anaemia.
    * Fat\
    Blood:gas partition coefficient increases following fat ingestion.
* **Alveolar blood flow**\
Increased alveolar blood flow increases uptake and delivery to tissues, including the CNS.
    * However, the increased uptake causes a reduction in P~A~\
    Therefore, **rate of onset** is **reduced** when **alveolar blood flow** is **high**. 
        * This effect is more pronounced with agents with a high blood:gas partition coefficient
        * Alveolar blood flow is a function of:
            * Cardiac output\
            * Shunt
* **Alveolar-Venous partial pressure gradient**\
The difference in partial pressure of agent in the alveolus and venous blood is due to the uptake of drug in tissues. Tissue uptake is dependent on:
    * Tissue blood flow\
    As the CNS has a high blood flow, it will equilibrate more quickly.
    * Blood:tissue solubility coefficients
        * Muscle has similar affinity to blood, but equilibrates more slowly than the CNS due to lower blood flow
        * Fat has a much higher affinity for anaesthetic than muscle, but equilibrates very slowly due to the very low blood flow\
        This is of greater importance in the obese, especially during prolonged anaesthesia, as they have a longer equilibration time and therefore prolonged emergence.

### Wash-out of Inhalational Agents{#wash}

Recovery is dependent on how quickly an inhalational agent can be eliminated from the effect site, and can be graphed by the F~A~/F~A0~ ratio over time:

<img src="resources/fa-fao.svg">


Washout can be divided into:

* Rapid washout\
Of agent in circuit and FRC.
    * The time constant for removal of agent from the circuit is a function of circuit volume and fresh gas flow, i.e.\
    $\tau = {CV \over FGF}$
* Slow washout\
Of agent in patient.
    * The time constant for removal of agent from the patient is a function of FRC and minute ventilation, i.e.\
    $\tau = {FRC \over MV}$

Factors affecting volatile washout:

* Brain-Blood and Tissue-Blood
    * Tissue:Blood coefficient of agent
    * Duration and depth of anaesthesia\
    Important for highly soluble agents used in long cases.
* Blood-Alveolus
    * Blood:gas coefficient of agent\
    Highly soluble agents will have an increased amount of drug dissolved in tissue, so a large reservoir of drug exists that will have to be removed.
    * Alveolar Cardiac output\
    **Decreased** cardiac output **increases** elimination.
        * Shunt\
        Decreases elimination.
* Alveolus-Air
    * MV~A~/FRC\
    Increased alveolar ventilation increases elimination. 
* Other factors
    * Metabolism of agent\
    Agents undergoing metabolism are eliminated more rapidly.
    * Absorption of agent into circuit
    * Percutaneous loss\
    Loss of agent by diffusion from tissues into external environment.  \


### Alteration to Pharmacokinetics

Increased rate of induction in **children** due to:

* Increased V~A~/FRC ratio\
Increases P~A~.
* Lower albumin and cholesterol\
Reduced blood-gas solubility coefficients for some agents.
  \
Increased rate of induction in **elderly** due to:

* Lower MAC requirement
* Lower albumin\
Reduces blood-gas solubility coefficients for some agents.
* Lower cardiac output\
P~a~ and therefore P~B~ is established more rapidly.

Altered rate of induction in **pregnancy** due to:

* Increased V~A~/FRC ratio
    * Increased minute ventilation\
    This is of greater importance in spontaneous ventilation, as this is controlled by the anaesthetist during controlled ventilation.
    * Decreased FRC\
Increases P~A~, increasing P~B~ and speed of onset.
* Lower albumin\
Reduces blood-gas solubility coefficients for some agents.
* Increased CO\
Reduces rate of rise of P~A~, reducing P~B~ and therefore speed of onset.
* Reduced MAC requirement\
Progesterone has some sedative properties.


### Alteration to Pharmacokinetics with Special Methods of Administration

In **target-controlled anaesthesia**, FGF and agent F~I~ are controlled by the machine to reach the target F~A~ rapidly at low concentrations. This causes:

* An initial over-pressure of F~I~, in order to fill the FRC and reach the desired F~A~
* A more rapid induction, as the target F~a~ is reached more rapidly

In **liquid injection**, anaesthetic agent is injected into the breathing system. This causes:

* A very large degree of overpressure\
In this circumstance, the rate of rise of end-expired agent concentration is identical for different agents.
    * i.e. Onset is independent of the blood:gas coefficient

## Mechanism of Action of Inhaled Anaesthetic Agents

Mechanisms of action can be divided into:

* **Macroscopic**\
At the level of the brain and spinal cord.
    * In the spine by:
        * Decreasing transmission of noxious afferent signals at the thalamus
        * Inhibition of spinal efferents, decreasing motor responses
    * In the brain by:
        * Global depression of CBF and glucose metabolism
* **Microscopic**\
Synapses and axons by:
    * Inhibiting pre-synaptic excitatory activity:
        * ACh
        * 5-HT
        * Glutamine
    * Augmenting post-synaptic inhibitory activity:
        * GABA~A~
* **Molecular**\
Anaesthetic agents may alter the function of molecules within the CNS. These include:
    * Alteration of α-subunits of the GABA~A~ receptor\
    This prolongs the time it spends open once activated, prolonging the inhibitory Cl^-^ current and increasing the degree of hyperpolarisation.
    * Enhance the activity of two-pore K^+^ channels\
    Increases the resting membrane potential of both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic CNS neurons.
  \
### Incomplete Theories of the Mechanism of Action of General Anaesthetic Agents

**Meyer-Overton Hypothesis**:

* Potency of anaesthetics relates to their lipid solubility\
* Anaesthetic molecules dissolve into CNS membranes, disrupting their effect
* Flaws:
    * Not all lipid soluble drugs have general anaesthetic affects
    * Other factors disrupt cell membranes without causing anaesthesia


** Volume Expansion**, **Pressure Reversal** (Mullin's Critical Volume Hypothesis):

* CNS cell membranes expand with general anaesthetic agents\
This distorts channels responsible for maintaining membrane potential and generating action potentials.
* Increased ambient pressure reverses general anaesthesia
* Flaws:
    * Does not account for stero-selectivity of drug-receptor interactions\
    I.e. receptors select for one stereoisomer over others.


### Structure-Activity Relationships of Inhaled Anaesthetics{#sa}

* Chemical structures of different volatile anaesthetics are covered in the [pharmacopeia](inhalational-anaesthetics.md).

Different chemical and physical properties alter the effect of inhalational agents:

* Physical
    * Molecular weight\
    A decrease in molecular weight decreases boiling point and therefore increases SVP.
* Chemical
    * H^+^ content\
    Greater hydrogen content:
        * Increases flammability
        * Increases potency
    * F^-^ content\
    Greater fluoride content:
        * Decreases flammability
        * Decreases oxidative metabolism\
        This decreases toxicity.
        * Decreases potency
    * Cl^-^ content\
    Increased chloride increases potency.
    * -CHF~2~ (Di-fluor-methyl group)\
        * Produces CO in the presence of dry soda lime
