# GABA Analogues


Gabapentin and pregabalin:

* Are both **structural analogues** of GABA
* Have no direct action on the GABA~A~ receptor
* **Act on the α~2~δ subunit of voltage gated Ca^2+^ channels** in the CNS, inhibiting neurotransmitter release
* May have some NMDA receptor activity

## Comparison of GABA Analogues
