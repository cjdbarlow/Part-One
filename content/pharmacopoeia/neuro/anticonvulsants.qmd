# Anticonvulsants


In **general**, anticonvulsants are:
- Well absorbed orally
- Highly protein bound
- Hepatically metabolised by CYP450 enzymes, and induce their own metabolism (as well as that of other drugs)
- Renally eliminated
- Interact with each other


|Property|Phenytoin|Sodium Valproate|Carbamazepine|Levetiracetam
|--|--|
|**Uses**|GTCS, partial seizures, trigeminal neuralgia, ventricular arrhythmias|Partial seizures|Antiepileptic, trigeminal neuralgia|GTCS, partial seizures, myoclonic seizures, seizure prophylaxis
|**Presentation**|Capsules, syrup, solution. IV formulation incompatible with dextrose.|Tablets, syrup, solution|Tablets, suppositories, syrup|Tablets, oral liquid, IV liquid
|**Route of Administration**|PO, IV, IM|PO, IV|PO|PO, IV (over 15 minutes)
|**Dosing**|15-20mg.kg^-1^ load, aiming plasma levels 10-20mcg.ml^-1^|300-1250mg BD|50-800mg BD|Typically 1g loading, then 500mg BD increasing up to 1.5g BD. Dose adjusted in renal impairment.
|**Mechanism of Action**|Stabilises Na^+^ channels in their inactive state, inhibiting generation of further action potentials. |Stabilises Na^+^ channels in their inactive state and potentiates GABA|Stabilises Na^+^ channels in their inactive state and potentiates GABA|Unknown, but different to other antiepileptics and may be related to inhibition of N-type Ca^2+^ currents
|**Absorption**|Slow PO absorption. PO bioavailability 90%|PO bioavailability 100%|95% PO bioavailability|Near 100% PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|Highly protein bound|Highly protein bound|Highly protein bound|Nil significant protein binding, V~D~ ~0.5L.kg^-1^
|**Metabolism**| Hepatic hydroxylation with highly individual variation in dosing. Obeys first-order kinetics in the therapeutic range, and **zero-order kinetics just above the therapeutic range**. Metabolised by **CYP450**. Induces warfarin, benzodiazepines, OCP metabolism. Inhibited by metronidazole, chloramphenicol, isoniazid. **Genetic polymorphism** results in reduced metabolism in 5-15% of patients. |Hepatic to inactive and active metabolites|Hepatic|Hepatic hydrolysis to inactive metabolites
|**Elimination**|Renal elimination of inactive metabolites and active drug|Renal elimination of metabolites and active drug|Renal elimination|Renal of active drug (major route) and metabolite (minor route)
|**CVS**|↓ BP, heart block, and asystole with rapid administration, antiarrhythmic properties||Antiarrhythmic||
|**CNS**|↑ Seizure threshold, paraesthesia, ataxia, nystagmus, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo.|↑ Seizure threshold|↑ Seizure threshold|↑ Seizure threshold, anxiolytic. Minimal ↓ in seizure threshold on cessation.
|**Renal**|||Water retention from ADH-like effects|Rarely precipitates AKI|
|**GIT**|Hepatotoxicity (idiosyncratic). Nausea and vomiting.||Hepatotoxicity.||
|**Haeme**|Aplastic anaemia and other blood dyscrasias||Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (requires regular testing)|Thrombocytopenia|
|**Immune**|Rash|||SJS|
|**Metabolic**||Hyperammonaemia|||
|**Other**|Requires monitoring due to narrow therapeutic window and significant pharmacokinetic variation. <br> Gum hyperplasia. <br>Teratogenic. <br>May precipitate porphyria.||Reduces efficacy of aminosteroids. <br> Teratogenic.||
