# Antidepressants


*Symptoms and management of TCA overdose is covered under [Tricyclic Antidepressant Overdose](tricyclic_antidepressant_overdose.md).*

Antidepressant drugs include:

* Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\
Mechanism of action by multiple effects, including:
  * Competitively inhibit reuptake of NA and 5-HT
  * Muscarinic antagonism\
  Leads to anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention).
  * H~1~ and H~2~ antagonism
  * α~1~ antagonism
  * NMDA antagonism
* Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)
  * Inhibit neural reuptake of 5-HT
  * Preferred over TCAs as:
    * Similar effectiveness
    * Better side effect profile
* Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAO-Is)
  * Inhibit monoamine oxidase on external mitochondrial membrane, increasing the level of amine neurotransmitters in the CNS and PNS\
  Two enzymes exist:
    * MAO-A
      * Dominant enzyme in CNS
      * Acts on serotonin, noradrenaline, adrenaline
    * MAO-B
      * Dominant in GIT and platelets
      * Responsible for 75% of MAO activity
      * Preferential metabolism of non-polar amines
  * MAO-Is classified by their mechanism and selectivity
    * Non-selective, irreversible\
    Bind covalently to the enzyme, permanently inactivating it.
      * May lead to hypertensive crisis when catecholamine levels increased
        * Tyramine in food\
        Metabolised by MAO-B.
        * Indirectly acting **sympathomimetics**\
        Absolutely contraindicated.
      * Risk of serotonin syndrome with serotonin reuptake inhibitors
      * Include:
        * Phenelzine
        * Isocarboxazid
        * Tranylcypromine
      * Enzyme levels will take 2-3 weeks to recover following cessation
    * MAO-A selective, reversible
      * Hypertensive crisis is less common
        * MAO-B unaffected - tyramine is metabolised
        * Short acting\
        Enzyme levels normalise after 24 hours of cessation.
      * Include:
        * Moclobemide
    * MAO-B selective
      * Much lower risk of hypertensive crisis
      * Include:
        * Selegiline
  * Discontinuation syndrome may occur if abruptly ceased

|Property|Tricyclic Antidepressants|Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors|Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
|--|--|
|**Example**|Amitriptyline|Fluoxetine|
|**Uses**|Depression, treatment of chronic pain and trigeminal neuralgia|Depression, anxiety|Treatment resistant depression. Now largely superseded due to side-effect profile
|**Absorption**|High PO bioavailability|High PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|Highly lipid soluble with High V~D~. Very highly protein bound - leads to interactions with warfarin, digoxin, and aspirin|Highly protein bound, high V~D~
|**Metabolism**|Hepatic with active metabolites. Large interpatient variability|Hepatic with non-linear kinetics <br><br>Venlafaxine does not affect CYP450 enzymes.
|**Elimination**||Unaffected by renal impairment
|**Resp**|Dry mouth
|**CVS**|Postural hypotension, ↑ HR.<br>QT prolongation and widening QRS in overdose, with arrhythmia more likely when QRS exceeds 0.16s.|Less cardiotoxic than TCAs, may precipitate serotonin syndrome
|**CNS**|Sedation, blurred vision, lowered seizure threshold. Excitation, followed by seizures and depression in overdose.|Identical antidepressant effect to TCAs. Less sedation
|**Renal**|Urinary retention||
|**GU**|Sexual dysfunction|Greater incidence of sexual dysfunction compared with TCAs
|**GIT**|Constipation|Greater incidence of N/V compared with TCAs
|**Other**|Multiple complex drug interactions, including arrhythmias and variable BP with sympathomimetics, central anticholinergic syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and seizures. <br><br>↑ Sensitivity to catecholamines - suggest avoiding:<br>-Indirectly acting sympathomimetics<br>-Ketamine<br>-Surgical stress|Continue during perioperative period to avoid risk of discontinuation syndrome.



## Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin syndrome is excessive serotonin in the CNS, typically as a consequence of drug interactions. The syndrome may be mild, moderate, or severe, and presents with some or all of:

* Altered mental state
  * Confusion
* Motor changes
  * Myoclonus
  * Hyperreflexia
  * Tremor
* Autonomic instability
  * Diaphoresis
  * Shivering
  * Fever

Serotonin syndrome is typically self-limiting and resolves with cessation of the drug.
