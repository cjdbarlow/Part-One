# Acid Suppression


|Property|Non-Particulate Antacids|Particulate Antacids|Proton Pump Inhibitors|H~2~ receptor antagonists|
|---|---|
|**Example**|Sodium citrate|Aluminium Hydroxide/Calcium carbonate|Omeprazole|Ranitidine
|**Uses**|Aspiration prophylaxis|Aspiration prophylaxis|Aspiration prophylaxis, GORD, peptic ulceration|Aspiration prophylaxis, GORD, peptic ulceration|
|**Absorption**|Rapid absorption due to high water solubility|Lower water solubility results in slower absorption and onset but no risk of alkalosis|Absorbed in small bowel, high PO bioavailability|50% PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|||Low V~D~ of 0.3 L.kg^-1^|15% protein bound
|**Metabolism**|||Prodrug, activated within parietal cell. CYP450 metabolised, inhibits CYP2C19 (reducing, among other things, the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel)|Partial hepatic by CYP450
|**Elimination**|||Renal of metabolites and active drug|Renal of metabolites and active drug
|**Mechanism of Action**|Base reacts with gastric acid to produce salt and water|Base reacts with gastric acid to produce salt and water|Irreversible antagonism of the parietal H^+^/K^+^ ATPase|Competitive antagonism of the (Gs) H~2~ receptor, which ↓ cAMP production, ↓ intracellular Ca^2+^, and ↓ activity of the H^+^/K^+^ ATPase
|**Resp**|Lower risk of pneumonitis if aspirated|Greater risk of pneumonitis if aspirated|Potentially increased severity of pneumonia if aspiration occurs (risk with micro-aspiration in long-term intubated patients)|Pneumonitis/pneumonia as per PPI
|**CVS**||||↓ HR, ↓ BP, and arrhythmogenic with rapid IV administration
|**Renal**|Potential metabolic alkalosis|No risk of alkalosis|Interstitial nephritis||
|**GIT**|↑ Gastric pH|↑ Gastric pH|↑ Gastric pH (pH ↑ by ~1), ↓ volume of secretions||
|**Other**|Taste bad||||
