# Key Definitions

* **Pain**\
Pain is an "unpleasant sensory or emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in such terms." Pain can be broadly classified into:
	* Aetiology
		* **Nociceptive pain**\
			Stimulation of nociceptors by noxious stimuli.
		* **Visceral pain**\
		* **Neuropathic pain**\
		Nervous system dysfunction.
	* Duration
		* Acute pain\
		Pain due to symptoms of current pathology.
		* **Chronic pain**\
		Pain occurring after the pathological process has resolved.


* **Hyperalgesia**\
Increased response to a normally painful stimulus.
	* Primary hyperalgesia\
	Local reduction in pain threshold.
	* Secondary hyperalgesia\
	Hyperalgesia away from the site of injury due to alteration in spinal cord signaling.


* **Allodynia**\
Painful response to a normally painless stimuli. Occurs due to pathological synapse between second-order neurones in the spinal cord.


* **Anaesthesia dolorosa**\
Pain in an area which is anaesthetised.


## Peripheral Nociception

Nociceptors are receptors which respond to a noxious stimulus. Nociceptors:

* Can be **stimulated** or **sensitised** by:
	* Chemical signals\
	See table.
	* Mechanical signals
		* Shear stress
	* Thermal signals
		* Hot nociceptors activate above 43°C
		* Cold nociceptors activate below 26°C
* Stimulation initiates a nervous impulse
* Sensitisation increases a receptors sensitivity to a stimulating mediator\


Key chemical stimulating and sensitising mediators include:

| Stimulating Mediators | Sensitising Mediators |
|-----------------------+-----------------------|
| H^+^                  | Prostaglandins        |
| K^+^                  | Leukotrienes          |
| ACh                   | Substance P           |
| Histamine             | Neurokinin A          |
| 5-HT                  | Calcitonin GRP        |
| Bradykinin            |                       |


### Nociception

Impulses are conducted by two types of **primary afferent fibres**:

* Aδ fibres:
	* Small (~**2-5μm** diameter)
	* **Myelinated**
	* Conduct sharp pain at up to 40m.s^-1^\
	* Mediate initial reflex responses to acute pain
	* Synapse in laminae I in the dorsal horn\
	Substance P is the neurotransmitter at the NK1 receptor.
* C fibres:
	* **<2μm** diameter
	* **Unmyelinated**
	* Conduct dull pain at 2m.s^-1^
	* Synapse in laminae II in the dorsal horn\
	Substance P is the neurotransmitter at the NK1 receptor.


## Pain Pathways and Site of Action of Analgesics

The response to a painful stimulus requires a cascade of processes:

* **Activation of nociceptors**\
	Membrane depolarisation in response to stimulus. If the stimulus is great enough to reach the threshold potential, an action potential is generated.
	* **NSAIDS** reduce nociceptor mediated inflammation
	* **Opiates** act on peripheral MOP receptors
	* **Local anaesthetics** prevent signal propagation
* **Synapse in the dorsal horn**\
	Input from both Aδ and C fibres, and descending interneurons.
	* Descending inhibitory input reduces nociceptive transmission\
	Basis of "gate control" theory. Descending input increased with:
		* Touch\
		Aβ 'touch' fibres stimulate inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal horn, 'closing the gate' by increasing **descending inhibition** and prevent signals from peripheral C fibres from rising to the thalamus.
		* Arousal
		* Opioid receptors\
		**Opioids** act pre-synaptically to reduce Substance P and glutamine release.
		* α~2~ receptors\
		**Clonidine**, **tricyclic antidepressants**, **noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitors**, and endogenous catecholamines.
		* **Gabapentin and pregabalin** inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter release
	* **Wide dynamic range** neurones\
	Receive afferent input from chemical, thermal, and mechanoreceptors.\
		* Typically more difficult to stimulate
		* Important in **wind-up**\
		Mediated by NMDA agonism.
			* **Ketamine** reduces windup and central sensitisation
		* Lead to secondary hyperalgesia
		* Lead to allodynia\
		Via additional synapses to sensory neurones in lamina III and IV.
* Interneuron synapses with a **second-order neurones** fibre\
These secondary afferents:
	* Cross within 1-2 vertebral segments and ascends in the spinothalamic tract
	* Receives input from descending fibres
	* **Opioids** act post-synaptically to hyperpolarise second-order neurones
* **Reflex arc**
* **Higher centres**\
Pain perception occurs in the somatosensory cortex.

## Neuropathic Pain

Pain due to a lesion of the somatosensory system, rather than a stimulus itself. Neuropathic pain is divided into:

* Central neuropathic pain\
From CNS injury, e.g. spinal cord injury, CVA, multiple sclerosis.
* Peripheral neuropathic pain\
Damage from:
	* Diabetes\
	Ischaemia of Schwann cells causes demyelination, causing the exposed axon to generate action potentials inappropriately.
	* Trauma\
	Transected axons may regrow with endings that spontaneously fire or that have altered threshold potentials.

### Mechanisms of Neuropathic Pain

* Neuroma\
Healing of damaged nerves leads to neuroma formation. Neuromas:
	* Are more sensitive to painful stimuli
	* Cause spontaneous pain
	* May sprout and innervate local tissues\
	Movement of these tissues may lead to pain.
* Windup
* Phantom limb pain\
Neurons damaged in removal of a limb develop additional synapses, leading to phantom sensations.

### Features of Neuropathic Pain

Neuropathic pain is associated with:

* Injury or disease that causes nerve injury
* Burning or electrical quality
* Reduced or absent sensation
* Poor response to typical analgesia

### Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome

Damage to the SNS can lead to abnormalities in autonomic function:

* Change in temperature due to vasomotor dysfunction
* Altered sweating
* Reduced hair growth
* Osteoporosis
* Hyperalgesia and allodynia

## Pain in the Elderly

Nervous System Changes:

* **Peripheral Nervous System**\
	* Nerve deterioration
	* Decreased myelination
	* Decreased conduction velocity
	* Reduced range and speed of ANS responses
	* Increased resting sympathetic tone
* **Central Nervous System**\
	* Decreased pain perception
	* Increased sensitivity to anaesthetic and analgesics\
	Reach ceiling effects more rapidly.
	* Degeneration of myelin\
	Subsequent cognitive dysfunction due to neuronal circuit dysfunction.
	* Generalised atrophy
	* Decreased neurotransmitter production
