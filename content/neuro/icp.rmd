# Intracranial Pressure

:::CICM
Explain the control of intra-cranial pressure
:::

:::ANZCA
Outline the factors determining intracranial pressure and discuss its regulation
:::

Normal ICP is â‰¤13mmHg, with some rhythmic variation occurring on the transduced waveform:

* **P1** is the first peak, and represents arterial pulsation
* **P2** is the second peak, and represents intracranial compliance\
If P2>P1, this is suggestive of poor intracranial compliance
* **P3** is the third peak, and is a dicrotic wave representing valve closure

In addition, a second set of Lundberg waves are described:

* **A waves** are **pathological**, and consist of square-wave plateaus up to 50mmHg lasting **5-20 minutes**. They are suggestive of **herniation**, and are always pathological.
* **B waves** are variable spikes in ICP at 30-120 second intervals, suggestive of cerebral **vasospasm**
* **C waves** are oscillations that occur 4-8 times per minute, and are a benign phenomena occurring with respiratory and blood pressure variations

**Raised intracranial pressure** may cause focal ischaemia when ICP >20mmHg, and global ischaemia when the ICP >50mmHg:

## Monroe Kellie Doctrine

This states that:

* The skull is a rigid container of a fixed volume, containing approximately 8 parts brain, 1 part blood, and 1 part CSF
* As it has negligible elastance, any **increase in volume** of one substance must **be met with** a **decrease in volume** of another **or** a **rise in ICP**^[Elastance is the *technically* correct term when discussing ICP, as we are discussing a change in *pressure* for a given change in volume.\
\
Compliance is a change in *volume* for a given change in pressure.]


### Physiological Responses to an Increase in ICP

* Displacement of CSF into the spinal subarachnoid space
* Compression of vascular bed
* Increased CSF reabsorption


* The Cushing reflex may occur in brainstem herniation\
Occurs as a reflex SNS response to medullary ischaemia, and describes a **triad** of:
	* Hypertension\
	To improve CPP.
 	* Bradycardia\
 	Due to a baroreceptor response.
 	* Irregular respiration\
 	Due to respiratory centre dysfunction.


## Physiological Basis of Treatment

Treatment can be classified as per the Monroe Kellie doctrine:

### Brain

* **Osmotic agents** such as mannitol and hypertonic saline\
Increase plasma osmolality and expand blood volume, creating an osmotic gradient between brain parenchyma and blood with a resulting reduction in brain oedema and ICP.
* Timely **evacuation** of mass lesions and intracranial haemorrhage

### CSF

* **External Ventricular Drain**\
Facilitates removal of CSF.

### Blood

* Reducing cerebral metabolic rate\
Results in reduced blood flow due to **flow-metabolism coupling**. May be achieved with:
    * **CNS depressants** such as propofol, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates\
    Have several beneficial effects:
        * Depress cerebral metabolism which reduces oxygen requirements
        * Reduce **seizure** risk, which is detrimental because it greatly increases cerebral O~2~ demand and impairs venous return
        * Improves ventilator dyssynchrony, limiting coughing and bearing down, and subsequent rises in ICP
    * **Avoid hyperthermia**\
    Causes a reduction in cerebral metabolism and risk of seizures. 
    * **Prevention of hypoxia or hypercapnea**\
    Hypoxia and hypercapnea both cause vasodilatation, with a subsequent increase in cerebral blood volume, blood flow, and ICP.
        * Aim **low-normal CO~2~**\
        Causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent reduction in cerebral blood flow and blood volume. This leads to:
            * Reduction in ICP
            * Reduction in cerebral oxygen delivery\
            Consequently, a low-normal ETCO~2~ target is used to avoid tissue hypoxia.
