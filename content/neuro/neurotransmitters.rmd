# Neurotransmitters


> Describe the major neurotransmitters and their physiological role, with particular reference to GABA, excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin and NMDA receptor

## GABA


Gamma aminobutyric acid is the major inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter. GABA receptors have three subtypes:

* GABA~A~\
Inotropic receptor important for the action of many drugs.
    * Pentameric structure
        * 2 α\
        Bind GABA.
        * 2 β
        * 1 γ
    * Affected by many different drugs:
        * Benzodiazepines\
        Positive allosteric modulation at at the α/γ interface.
        * General anaesthetic agents\
        Including propofol, barbiturates, halogenated volatiles, and etomidate.
            * Act at the β subunit\
            Cause a conformational change which increases Cl^-^ opening time, hyperpolarising the cell.
* GABA~B~\
Metabotropic receptor.
* GABA~C~\
Inotropic receptor located only in the retina.


## NMDA


N-methyl D-aspartate receptor is an inotropic receptor that is:

* Agonised by glutamate
    * Glycine is co-agonist
* Voltage dependent\
    * Central pore usually blocked by an Mg^2+^ ion
    * Becomes unblocked when partially depolarised
* Important in the action of drugs which do not act at the GABA~A~ receptor \
Antagonised by:
    * Ketamine
    * Xenon
    * N~2~O
