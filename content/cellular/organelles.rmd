# Organelles

:::CICM
Describe ~~the cell membrane and~~ cellular organelles and their properties
:::

:::ANZCA
Outline basic cellular physiology in particular: ~~The structure of the cell membrane and trans-membrane transport mechanisms, The composition and regulation of intracellular fluid, The generation of the trans-membrane potential,~~ Energy production by metabolic processes in cells
:::

Organelles are specialised functional subunits within a cell, typically contained within their own lipid bilayer.

Key organelles include:

* Mitochondria
* Endoplasmic reticulum
* Golgi apparatus

## Mitochondria

Mitochondria:

* Produce ATP via aerobic metabolism\
Only method of aerobic metabolism in the body.
    * Mitochondria exist in greater numbers in more metabolically active cells
* Consist of two membranes (outer and inner), which create three spaces, 
    * Cytoplasm\
    Outside the outer membrane.
    * Intermembrane space\
    Between the membranes.
        * Outer membrane separates mitochondria from cytoplasm, but contains pores allowing some substances (pyruvate, amino acids, fatty acids) to pass
        * Inner membrane:
            * Isolates the electron transport chain from the intermembrane (space between inner and outer membranes) space.
            * Proteins on the inner membrane conduct the redox reactions important for ATP production
            * Electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions into the intermembrane space
    * Inner mitochondrial matrix\
    Contents important in many metabolic processes:
        * Citric acid cycle
        * Fatty acid metabolism
        * Urea cycle
        * Haeme synthesis
