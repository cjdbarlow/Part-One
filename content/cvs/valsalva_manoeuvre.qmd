# Valsalva Manoeuvre

:::CICM
Explain the response of the circulation to situations such as ~~changes in posture haemorrhage, hypovolaemia, anaemia, intermittent positive pressure ventilation, positive end-expiratory pressure, and~~ the Valsalva manoeuvre.
:::

A Valsalva is forced expiration against a closed glottis. This can be achieved by increasing P~AW~ to 40mmHg for 15 seconds. This increase in intrathoracic pressure alters many haemodynamic parameters.

## Phases

A Valsalva manoeuvre consists of four phases:

### Phase I

* P~AW~ is increased to 40cmH~2~O, with a corresponding increase in P~Thoracic~
* SBP and DBP increase due to:
    * Compression of the aorta
    * Increased LV preload due to ejection of blood in the pulmonary vasculature

### Phase II

* VR falls due to increased P~Thoracic~
* CO falls due to decreased VR
* SBP and DBP fall due to decreased CO
* Baroreceptor activity is â†“ by the fall in BP, and SNS outflow increases, causing:
    * Increased HR
    * Increased SVR
        * BP therefore starts to recover late in Phase II

### Phase III

* The Valsalva ceases, and P~AW~ returns to 0cmH~2~O
* PVR rapidly drops as alveolar vessels re-expand
* SBP and DBP rapidly fall due to:
    * Decreased PVR causing decreased LV preload
    * Loss of high intrathoracic pressure compressing the aorta

### Phase IV

* VR normalises
* CO normalises due to normal VR and PVR
* SBP and DBP transiently increase due to a normal CO entering a baroreceptor-driven high-SVR vascular bed
* Baroreceptors respond to high SBP an DBP by increasing vagal tone:
    * HR falls (reflex bradycardia)
    * BP falls

## Abnormal Responses

Abnormal responses occur in cardiac failure and autonomic neuropathy.

### Cardiac Failure

::: column-margin
This square-wave patten appears to be due to the increased circulating volume, as this difference resolves in venesected cardiac patients, and is demonstrated in normal individuals who are transfused to a high circulating volume.
:::

In CCF a square-wave patten is produced:

* Increasing P~AW~ resulting in a sustained **increase** in SBP and DBP
* There is a slight decrease in SBP and DBP for the few seconds in phase III when airway pressure is released

### Autonomic Neuropathy

Baroreceptor response to the Valsalva is minimal in both phase II and IV:

* In phase II, there is no compensatory increase in sympathetic outflow, so BP continues to fall until P~AW~ returns to 0mmHg
* In phase IV, there is no compensatory increase in vagal tone and so BP returns to normal without overshooting
