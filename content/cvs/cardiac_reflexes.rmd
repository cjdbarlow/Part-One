# Cardiac Reflexes

:::CICM
Describe the cardiac reflexes
:::

Cardiac reflexes are fast-acting reflex loops between the CVS and CNS which contribute to the maintenance of cardiovascular haemostasis.

They include:

* **Baroreceptor reflex**\
Aortic arch and carotid sinus reflexes.
* **Bainbridge reflex**\
Atrial stretch receptor reflexes.
* **Chemoreceptor reflex**\
Decreased PaO~2~ < 50mmHg or decreased pH sensed by peripheral chemoreceptors causes subsequent tachycardia and hypertension.
* **Cushing reflex**\
Brainstem compression causes ischaemia of the vasomotor centre leading to Cushings' Triad:
    * Hypertension\
    May have a wide pulse pressure.
    * Bradycardia\
    Due to baroreceptor response from hypertension.
    * Irregular respirations
* **Bezold-Jarisch reflex**\
Stimulation of C fibres of the vagus nerve in the cardiopulmonary region.
    * This causes:
        * Significant bradycardia
        * Hypotension
        * Apnoea, followed by rapid shallow breathing.
    * These fibres can be stimulated by a number of substances, including:
        * Capsaicin
        * Serotonin
        * Those produced in myocardial ischaemia
* **Oculocardiac reflex**\
Pressure on the globe or traction on ocular muscles causes a decrease in heart rate. This is mediated by the:
    * Trigeminal nerve (afferent limb)
    * Vagus nerve (efferent limb)\
    Increased vagal tone reduces SA nodal activity.
