:::

^[This section covers determinants of cardiac output from the perspective of the heart. The relationship to and importance of [venous return](venous-return.md) is covered elsewhere.]Cardiac output a function of Heart Rate (HR) and Stroke Volume (SV); $CO = HR \times SV$:

* **Heart rate** is fairly intuitive
* **Stroke volume** is defined as the difference between ESV and EDV, i.e. $SV = EDV - ESV$\
Stroke volume is a function of three factors:^[Preload and afterload have [almost as many definitions as there are textbooks](http://advan.physiology.org/highwire/markup/5806/expansion?width=1000&height=500&iframe=true&postprocessors=highwire_figures%2Chighwire_math%2Chighwire_inline_linked_media). For the purpose of the exam, it's good to have both a laboratory and a clinical definition. These definitions are those which have appeared in old examiner reports, or given to me by cardiac anaesthetists.]
    * **Preload**
    * **Afterload**
    * **Contractility**


## Preload

**Preload** is defined as the **myocardial sarcomere length just prior to contraction**:

* As this is not measurable without removing the heart and cutting it into tiny pieces, clinically it is usually **approximated by EDV** or, less appropriately, by EDP
    * EDV is typically calculated on echocardiography
    * EDP is typically measured using a CVC or PAC
        * CVP ≈ RVEDP
        * PCWP ≈ LVEDP


### Determinants of Preload

Preload is a function of:

* **Venous Return**
    * Intrathoracic Pressure
    * MSFP
        * Venous compliance\
        A decrease in venous compliance will increase LVEDP.
        * Volume state
* **Ventricular compliance**\
Reduced in diastolic dysfunction.
* **Pericardial compliance**
* **Valvular disease**\
    * AV valve disease will **impair** preload
    * Semilunar valve disease will **increase** preload
* **Atrial kick**
* **Wall thickness**\
Increased ventricular wall thickness decreases preload.
    * HOCM/Hypertrophy\


### Preload and the Respiratory Cycle

* Negative intrathoracic pressure causes RAP and PCWP to fall
* This increases RA filling, so and RVEDP and RVEDV increase relative to the pleural pressure (though absolute pressure is still low)
* LV effects are more variable\
Negative intrapleural pressures:
    * Increase LV transmural pressure\
    This impairs ejection.
    * Cause bowing of the interventricular septum into the LV\
    This reduces LVEDV.


### Frank-Starling Mechanism{#frank}

* The **Frank-Starling Law of the Heart** states that the **strength of cardiac contraction is dependent on initial fibre length**
* At a cellular level, additional stretch increases:
    * The number of myofilament crossbridges that can interact
    * Myofilament Ca^2+^ sensitivity

* This law is represented by the **ventricular function curve**\
Plot of preload against stroke volume (or cardiac output, assuming a constant heart rate).
    * Right shift of the curve demonstrates negative inotropy
    * Left shift of the curve demonstrates positive inotropy

The failing ventricle:

<img src="resources/starling-curve-failing.svg">

* In cardiac failure, the ventricle becomes overstretched\
This reduces the number of overlapping crossbridges, reducing contractility.
* This is limited in the acute setting by constriction of the pericardium, which prevents excessive ventricular dilation


## Afterload

**Afterload** is **the ventricular wall stress at the onset of systole.** This is given by the **Law of Laplace** $\theta \propto {P \times r \over T}$, where:

* $\theta$ is ventricular wall stress
* $r$ is ventricular chamber radius\
This is a proxy for ventricular size, or end-diastolic volume.
* $P$ is ventricular transmural pressure
* $T$ is ventricular wall thickness


### End-Diastolic Volume 

An increase in EDV increases ventricular radius and therefore wall tension.

### Myocardial Wall Thickness

Increasing wall thickness (seen clinically as ventricular hypertrophy) *decreases* afterload by sharing wall tension (the product of pressure and radius) between a larger number of sarcomeres.

### Ventricular Transmural Systolic Pressure

Transmural pressure is the difference between intrathoracic pressure and the ventricular cavity pressure during ejection. Transmural pressure is dependent on:

* **Intrathoracic Pressure**\
Negative intrathoracic pressure will increase afterload, as the ventricle has to generate a greater change in pressure to achieve ejection.
    * PEEP reduces LV afterload
    * Negative-pressure ventilation with a high work of breathing increases afterload\
    This is why APO deteriorates - increased work of breathing increases LV afterload and worsens LV failure, increased pulmonary oedema, causing increased work of breathing... <br><br>
* **Ventricular cavity pressure**\
To facilitate ejection, the ventricle must overcome:
    * **Outflow tract impedance**
        * Valvular disease
        * e.g. aortic stenosis
        * HOCM
    * **Systemic arterial impedance**/Aortic input impedance\
    Determined by resistance (SVR), reflected pressure waves, **inertia**, and **compliance**:\
        * Determinants of **resistance** are stated in the Poiseuille Equation:\
            $R = {8.\eta.l \over \pi.r^4}$, where:
            * η = **Viscosity**\
            Affected by **haematocrit** (e.g. increased in polycythaemia) 
            * l = Vessel length\
            Essentially fixed.
            * r = Vessel **radius**\
                * Greatest determinant
                * Function of **degree of vasoconstriction** of resistance vessels
        * Reflected pressure waves\
        Reflection of pulse pressure waves from the distal circulation increases aortic pressure.
            * In normal circumstances this occurs during diastole (and so has less contribution to afterload)
            * Decreased compliance of the peripheral circulation increases the speed of propagation, so the pressure wave may return during systole and contribute to systolic blood pressure and afterload
        * **Inertia**\
            * Given by the mass of blood in the column
            * Affected by **heart rate**
        * Arterial **compliance**\
        Decreased arterial compliance increases afterload.
            * During ejection, the aorta and large arteries distend, reducing peak systolic pressure (impedance to further ejection)
            * Decreased arterial compliance increases the change in pressure for any given volume, increasing afterload during ejection
            * Decreased arterial compliance increases the speed of propagation of **reflected pressures waves** returning to the aortic root
                * Wave arrival in diastole augments coronary blood flow
                * Wave arrival during systole further increases afterload
            * In diastole the arteries recoil and blood pressure and flow are maintained - the **Windkessel effect**.

## Contractility

**Contractility** describes the **factors other than heart rate, preload, and afterload** that are **responsible for** for changes in **myocardial performance**.

### Determinants of Contractility

Contractility is primarily dependent on **intracellular Ca^2+^**.  Determinants include:

* Drugs
* Disease
    * Ischaemia\
    Reduced ATP production secondary to hypoxia, which impairs sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca^2+^ function. Further exacerbated by intracellular acidosis from anaerobic metabolism.
    * Heart Failure\
    Impaired **contractility reserve**, i.e. minimal increase in contractility with sympathetic stimulation.
        * Reduced peak Ca^2+^ and sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake of Ca^2+^
* Autonomic Tone
* Bowditch Effect\
Contractility improves at faster heart rates. This is because the myocardium does not have time to remove calcium, so it accumulates intracellularly.
* Anrep Effect\
Contractility increases as afterload increases.

### Measuring Contractility

As with the other determinants of cardiac output, there has been some difficulty in developing measurable indices for contractility, as all are affected by preload or afterload to a greater or lesser degree. Those used include:

* **dP/dt~max~** ($\Delta P \over \Delta T$)\
The **rate of rise** of LVP, assuming a constant preload and afterload
   * This index is **preload dependent** but **afterload independent**
   * Typically, the dP/dt~max~ in isovolumetric ventricular contraction is used
   * A greater rate of rise indicates a more forceful contraction
   * Measurement requires LV catheterisation
* **End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship**
    * Uses the ventricular Pressure-Volume Relationship
    * Line plotted at the tangent to the curve from the **end-systolic point** (when isovolumetric ventricular relaxation begins)
        * The steeper the gradient the greater the contractility
* **Ejection Fraction**\
Most common method used clinically is **ejection fraction**:\
$EF \ (\%) = {SV \over EDV } \times 100 = {EDV - ESV \over EDV} \times 100$
