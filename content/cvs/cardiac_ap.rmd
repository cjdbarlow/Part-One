An action potential is a propagating change in the membrane potential of an excitable cell, used in cellular communication and to initiate intracellular processes. It is caused by altering the permeability of a membrane to different ions.

## Pacemaker Potential

This pattern of electrical activity is seen in the SA and AV nodes. It  **has no resting state**, and is continually depolarising.

### Phases of the Pacemaker Potential


<img src="resources/pacemaker-phases.svg">

* **Phase 0**\
Begins at the threshold potential of **-40mV**, with a peak membrane potential of **20mV**. Driven predominantly by the voltage-gated L-type (long-lasting) Ca^2+^ channels causing an influx of calcium ions. 
* **Phase 3**\
Repolarisation phase, which occurs as K^+^ channels open and Ca^2+^ channels close. The nadir is called the **maximum diastolic potential** and is -**65mV**.
* **Phase 4**\
Phase 4 consists of:
    * The **funny current**\
    A steady influx of Na^+^/K^+^ which gradually depolarises the cell.
        * Sympathetic stimulation increases the funny current, increasing the rate of depolarisation.
        * Parasympathetic stimulation increases K^+^ permeability, hyperpolarising the cell and flattens the gradient of phase 4.
    * Calcium current\
    In phase 4, this is the transient calcium current, driven by T-type calcium channels. They open when the membrane potential reaches ~-50mV, also causing depolarisation.

## Ventricular Action Potential

To prevent tetanic contraction^[(Tetanic ventricular contraction would be bad.)] ventricular muscle has a long plateau prior to repolarisation, which lengthens the absolute refractory period to **250ms**. The relative refractory period is **50ms**.

### Phases of the Ventricular Action Potential

* **Phase 0**: Depolarisation\
At the threshold potential, voltage-gated **fast-Na^+^** channels open briefly, causing depolarisation. The membrane potential peaks at **30mV**.
* **Phase 1**: Partial Repolarisation\
The closure of Na^+^ channels results in K^+^ fleeing the cell down its electrochemical gradient, causing a slight drop in voltage called partial repolarisation.
* **Phase 2**: Plateau\
**L-type Ca^2+^ channels** open, causing a slow inward Ca^2+^ current which maintains depolarisation and facilitates muscle contraction.
* **Phase 3**: Repolarisation\
Membrane permeability normalises, and outward potassium current returns the membrane potential to normal.
* **Phase 4**: Resting Potential\
Membrane potential returns to its resting **-85mV**.

## Propagation of the Cardiac Action Potential

Pacemaker cells:

* Are responsible for automaticity and rhythmicity of the heart
* The fastest pacemaker is the focus for myocardial conduction\
This is typically the SA node.
    * Should the SA node fail, the next fastest pacemaker will take over
    * This provides an element of redundancy

Conduction pathway:

* **Atrial Conduction**\
From the SA node, the impulse travels at ~1m.s^-1^, depolarising the atria.
    * Current travels down **Bachmann's Bundle**, which connects the right atrium to the left atrium


* **AV node**\
The AV node is the only (normal) site of connection between the atria and ventricles. AV nodal cells:
    * Transmits with a delay of 0.1s\
    This allows time for atrial contraction to finish before ventricular contraction begins.
    * Have a prolonged refractory period and cannot conduct more than **220** impulses per minute
        * This period is prolonged by vagal stimulation, which increases potassium permeability and hyperpolarises the cell
        * Conversely, sympathetic stimulation increases calcium permeability and allows more rapid transmission
    * Conducts via three pathways:
        * Bachmann Pathway\
        Also conducts to the LA.
        * Wenckebach pathway
        * Thorel pathway


* **Ventricular Conduction**\
    From the AV node, the signal propagates:
    * Initially via the **Bundle of His** to the right and left bundles
    * Secondly via the **Purkinje fibres** which conduct at 1-4m.s^-1^\
    Purkinje fibres have a long refractory period, and spontaneously depolarise with an intrinsic rate of 30-40 bpm.
    * Lastly, ventricular muscle is depolarised\
    Endocardium, papillary muscle and septum contract first, followed by apex, followed by the chambers.


## Autonomic Control

* **Parasympathetic Innervation**\
    * SA node by the right vagus\
    There is continual PNS input ("Vagal tone") via inhibitory ACh GPCR, reducing the SA node from its intrinsic rate of 90-120bpm to a more sedate 60-100bpm.
    * AV node by the left vagus
    * The atria are innervated by parasympathetic neurons, whilst the ventricles are only minimally innervated\
    * PNS stimulation may have no direct effect on inotropy, instead acting indirectly via changes in chronotropy


* **Sympathetic Innervation**\
    * SNS activity causes release of noradrenaline (at post-ganglionic synapse) and adrenaline from adrenal medulla which stimulate cardiac β~1~ receptors causing:
        * Positive chronotropy at the SA node
        * Positive inotropy at ventricular muscle
        * Positive lusitropy
        * Shorter action potential duration (due to opening of rectifying K^+^ channels
        * Increased AV conduction

### Cardiac Transplant

The transplanted heart has no vagal/parasympathetic innervation but still expresses β~1~ receptors, so it:

* Defaults to a resting heart rate of ~100bpm
* Becomes highly preload dependent as it cannot respond quickly to changes in SVR
* Not responsive to parasympatholytics (atropine, glycopyrrolate) or ephedrine (as this is indirectly-acting) to increase chronotropy - isoprenaline may be used
* Gradual response to demands in exercise (lacks local SNS innervation, but will still respond to circulating catecholamines)
* Increased sensitivity to catecholamines due to increased expression of β~1~ receptors
