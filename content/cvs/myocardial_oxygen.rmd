Myocardial:

* Oxygen **supply** is a function of **coronary blood flow**
* Oxygen **demand** is determined by **myocardial work**
* **Ischaemia** occurs when **demand exceeds supply**

## Myocardial Oxygen Supply

Myocardial oxygen supply is dependent on three factors:

* Oxygen content of blood
* Oxygen extraction
* **Coronary artery flow**  
Coronary flow is *the* determinant (and therefore the limiting factor) in normal physiology, as:
    * Oxygen content in individuals without pulmonary disease is maximal
    * Resting myocardial oxygen extraction is near-maximal (**~70%**)\
    This high ER makes the heart **less tolerant of anaemia** than organs with a low ER.

### Coronary Blood Flow

Coronary blood flow is given by the equation:
$$CBF = {P_{Aortic \ Root} - P_{Cavity} \over Coronary \ Vascular \ Resistance}$$

Where:

* Aortic *root* pressure is the driving pressure for coronary flow\
* Cavity (ventricular) pressure acts as a **Starling resistor** for coronary flow\
    * Note that if RAP exceeds cavity pressure, RAP will be the pressure opposing coronary flow (due to downstream pressure at the coronary sinus)
* Note that **cavity and aortic root pressure change throughout the cardiac cycle**, therefore:
    * The flow to each ventricle is different during the cardiac cycle
    * The left ventricle is **best perfused in diastole**\
    Therefore **heart rate** is an important determinant of coronary blood flow, as **tachycardia will decrease coronary blood flow**
* Flow to each ventricle is a function of how relationships change over the cardiac cycle

## Myocardial Oxygen Demand

Normal myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO~2~) is 21-27ml.min^-1^. There are **five determinants**, which can be split into **three major** and **two minor** determinants.


### Major Determinants

The **three major determinants** are:

* **Heart rate**\
A change in heart rate will change the number of tension-generating cycles, causing a proportional change in MVO~2~.
* **Contractility**\
Refers to the **rate** of tension development as well as its **magnitude**. Changing $\Delta P \over \Delta t$ will change MVO~2~.
* **Ventricular wall tension**\
Ventricular wall tension is **pressure work**, or the work done by the ventricle to **generate pressure but not to eject volume**.
  * Wall tension is given by the **Law of LaPlace**\
  $Wall \ Tension = {P.r \over 2}$, where:
    * $P$= Pressure during contraction
    * $r$= Radius
 * Wall tension is therefore a function of:
   * **Afterload**\
   Increasing afterload will increase the pressure during contraction.
   * **Preload**\
   Increasing preload will increase radius, but to a **lesser extent than increasing afterload**.
     * This is because *volume* and *radius* are *not directly proportional*


### Minor Determinants

The **two minor determinants** of myocardial work are:

* **External work**\
External work can also be thought of as **volume work**, or the energy expended to eject blood from the ventricle.
  * This is encompassed by the area enclosed by the pressure-volume loop
    * Conversely, internal work is defined as the work required to change the shape of the ventricle and prepare it for ejection\
    On the pressure-volume loop internal work is represented by a triangle between the point of 0 pressure and volume, the end systolic point, and the beginning of rapid ventricular filling.
  * This is a minor determinant because the majority of ventricular work is generating the pressure required to eject blood, not actually move volume
  * External work is of greater importance at high CO
  * External work is used to calculate **cardiac efficiency**, given by the equation:\
  $Cardiac \ Efficiency = {External \ Work \over \ Myocardial \ O_2 \ Consumption }$
* **Basal oxygen consumption**\
Basal oxygen consumption (~8ml.min^-1^.100g^-1^) comprises ~25% of MVO~2~.
