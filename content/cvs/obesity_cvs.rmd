# Cardiovascular Changes with Obesity

:::CICM
Describe the cardiovascular changes that occur with morbid obesity
:::

Obesity is a multisystem disorder defined by an elevated body mass index (BMI):

* Normal: BMI < 25
* Overweight: BMI 25 - 30
* Obese: BMI > 30
* Morbidly Obese:
    * Obesity related disease and a BMI > 35
    * BMI > 40

Characteristics of obesity include:

* Complex genetic and environmental causes
* Increased caloric intake
* Increased metabolic rate (normal for BSA)

The effect of obesity on the cardiovascular system is complex, and can be classified into:

* Hormonal
* Cardiac

## Hormonal Changes

Abdominal visceral fat is responsible for secreting a large number of hormones which affect cardiovascular parameters:

* Increased leptin\
Contributes to cardiac remodelling and LVH.
* Angiotensinogen\
Leads to systemic hypertension and LV remodelling.
    * Small amounts are produced in adipocytes, which increases as fat volume increases
* Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1\
Reduces fibrinolysis and predisposes to VTE.
* Inflammatory adipokines\
Impair endothelial function, leading to increased SVR.
* Catecholamines\
Increased contractility, SVR, and worsen endothelial function.
    * Released with:
        * Hypoxia
        * Hypercapnea
        * Negative intrathoracic pressure
        * Fragmented sleep\
        Due to OSA.

## Cardiovascular Changes

These can be subdivided into:

* Changes in **key cardiovascular parameters**
    * Increased VO~2~\
    Due to increased LBM and fat mass.
    * Increased Blood Volume\
    Due to increased angiotensin II and aldosterone.
    * Increased Stroke Volume\
    Due to:
        * Increased preload (major factor)
        * Increased contractility (minor factor)\
        Due to increased circulating adrenal hormones.
    * Increased Cardiac Output\
    To maintain DO~2~.
        * Initially with preserved ejection fraction
* **Myocardial changes**
    * Diastolic dysfunction\
    Due to myocardial fibrosis impairing relaxation.
    * Fatty infiltration of myocardium and conducting system
        * Predisposes to arrhythmias\
        Risk is worsened by change in myocardial architecture, hypoxia, and increased circulating catecholamines.
    * Biventricular hypertrophy as a response to increased afterload
        * LV afterload increased due to systemic hypertension\
        LVH is much more common than RVH.
            * Eccentric hypertrophy due to volume overload
            * Concentric hypertrophy due to pressure overload or hormonal changes
        * RV hypertrophy due to:
            * LV diastolic failure
            * Increased PVR
                * Hypoxia\
                Due to:
                    * Effects of OSA
                    * Increased shunt through collapsed lung bases
                * Acidosis
