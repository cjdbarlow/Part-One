## Echocardiographic Anatomy

The left ventricle is:

* Divided into four parts\
From base to apex, in **equal thirds** along the long axis of the ventricle:
	* Basal
	* Mid-cavity\
	Identified by presence of the papillary muscles.
	* Apical
	* Apex\
	Tip of the ventricle, beyond where the cavity ends.
* Each part is divided into segments\
Total of **seventeen segments** between:
	* 6 basal and mid-cavity segments
		* Inferior\
		Mid-cavity contains the postero-medial papillary muscle.
		* Inferoseptal
		* Inferolateral
		* Anterior
		* Antero-septal
		* Antero-lateral\
		Mid-cavity contains the anterolateral papillary muscle.
	* 4 apical segments
		* Inferior
		* Anterior
		* Lateral
		* Septal
	* Apical cap\


### Coronary Supply

The segments of the basal and mid-cavity parts are supplied by all three vessels^[There is both variability in coronary supply to the same wall of different sections of the LV, as well as inter-individual variation (although the LAD territory is relatively fixed).\
\
Therefore, this is is not an *entirely* accurate representation, but it is a good general approximation.]:

In the apical part, the:

* LAD\
Supplies:
	* Anterior
	* Septal
* LCx\
Supplies:
	* Lateral
* RCA\
Supplies:
	* Inferior

The apical cap is supplied by the **LAD**.
