## Vascular Anatomy

### Coronary Artery Anatomy

<img src="resources/coronary.svg">

The **left main** coronary artery:

* Arises from the posterior aortic sinus superior to the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve\
Eddy currents produced in the **Sinuses of Valsalva** (outpouchings of the aortic wall) prevent the valves occluding the os of the LM and RCA during systole, so they remain patent throughout the cardiac cycle.
* The **left main** is 5-10mm long, and bifurcates to form the LAD and LCx
* The **intermediate** artery is an anatomical variant that arises from the bifurcation, creating a trifurcation


The **LAD**:

* Courses along the **anterior interventricular groove** to the apex of the heart\
Here, it anastomoses with the posterior descending artery from the RCA.
* **Supplies** the **anterolateral myocardium** and **anterior 2/3^rds^** of the interventricular **septum**
* **Branches** of the LAD include:
    * **Diagonal** vessels\
    Branches are named successively from proximal to distal (i.e. LADD~1~, LADD~2~, etc), and wrap around the anterior wall of the ventricle.^[The proximal LAD is defined as the area of LAD between the origin and D~1~, mid LAD is between D~1~ and D~2~, etc.]
    * **Septal perforators**\
    Penetrate into the myocardium.


The **LCx**:

* Courses along the **left atrioventricular** groove between the LA and LV in the epicardial fat pad
* **Supplies** the **inferolateral wall** of the **LV**
* Gives off three **obtuse marginal** branches (OM~1~, OM~2~, etc) which follow the left margin of the heart
* Runs in close approximation with the coronary sinus for much of its course


The **RCA**:

* Arises from the anterior aortic sinus, superior to the right coronary cusp of the aortic valve
* Courses vertically downwards in the **right atrioventricular groove**
* Supplies the RA and RV
* RCA gives off:
    * **Acute marginal arteries**^[Acute marginal arteries are almost never grafted.]
    * **Posterior branch to the LV** (PLV)

The **posterior descending artery**:

* Arises from either the LCx or RCA\
These vessels travel in opposite directions around the atrioventricular groove.
* Descends in the posterior interventricular groove before coursing along the base to anastomose with the LAD at the apex of the heart
* Is also known as the posterior interventricular artery


#### Coronary Dominance

Coronary dominance refers to which vessel gives rise to the PDA:

* In a **right-dominant** circulation the PDA is supplied by the **RCA**
* In a **left-dominant** circulation the PDA is supplied by the **LCx**

Additionally:

* The **SA node** is supplied by the **RCA in 60%** of individuals
* The **AV node** is supplied by the **RCA in 90%** of individuals

### Venous Anatomy

* 85% of venous drainage occurs via the **coronary sinus**
    * Drains the **LV**
    * Formed from the cardiac veins:
        * The **great cardiac vein** runs with the LAD
        * The **middle cardiac vein** follows the PDA
        * The **small cardiac vein** runs with the RCA
        * The **oblique vein** follows the posterior part of the LA
* Most of the remainder is via **anterior cardiac veins** which drain directly into the RA
* A small proportion of blood from the heart is drained via the **thebesian veins** directly into four the cardiac chambers\
Most into the right atrium, and least into the left ventricle. The portion of blood draining into the left side of the circulation contributes to **physiological shunt**.

## Coronary Blood Flow

Coronary Blood Flow:

* Normal is **~250ml.min^-1^** (~5% of resting CO)
* May increase 4x during strenuous exercise\
Myocardial *work* may increase up to 9x, though as myocardial oxygen extraction is unchanged efficiency is actually improved during exercise.


CBF is dependent on:

* Coronary vascular resistance
* Coronary perfusion pressure\
The difference between aortic root pressure and the greater of RAP or intracavity pressure: i.e. $CBF = {P_{Aorta} - P_{Cavity} \ or \ RAP \over CVR }$.
    * Note that the pressure gradient is usually Aorta-Cavity rather than Aorta-RA\
    This is because the pressure in the ventricle acts as a Starling resistor - coronary flow is independent of RAP whilst $RAP < P_{Cavity}$
* Heart rate\
LV CBF is affected in systole due to the changes in perfusion pressure, and compression of intramuscular vessels (causing an increase in CVR).
    * RV CBF is less affected, as the force of contraction is significantly smaller and a pressure gradient is maintained
    * Tachycardia reduces diastolic time and subsequently LV CBF

### Control of Coronary Blood Flow

CBF is controlled by:

* **Autonomic** mechanisms
    * **Direct** effects include:
        * Parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation of coronary vessels, with release of ACh or NA and A decreasing or increasing coronary blood flow
    *  **Indirect** effects
      *  Are more important than direct effects
      *  Are related to autoregulation occurring with changing levels of myocardial work in response to parasympathetic or sympathetic stimuli
* **Autoregulation**
    * **Myogenic autoregulation**\
        This is common to many organ systems, and occurs within the coronaries.
        * Increasing transmural pressure increases the leakiness of smooth muscle membranes, depolarising them
        * Resistance increases proportionally to pressure, such that flow remains constant
    * **Metabolic autoregulation**\
    Anaerobic metabolism results in production of vasoactive mediates such as **lactate** and **adenosine**, which stimulate vasodilation and therefore increase flow (and oxygen delivery).
        * This is the predominant means for autoregulation in the heart
        * Typical **myocardial oxygen extraction is 70%** and raising this further is difficult\
        Therefore, increasing oxygen supply requires an increase in blood flow.
