# Baroreceptors

:::CICM
Describe the function of baroreceptors and to relate this knowledge to common clinical situations.
:::

Baroreceptors are **stretch receptors** which monitor changes in arterial pressure. **Arterial pressure** is monitored by receptors in the:

* **Aortic arch**
    * Innervated by CNX
* **Carotid sinus**\
Small dilation of the ICA at the level of the bifurcation.
    * Innervated by CNIX
    * Remember the carotid *sinus* is a baroreceptor, the carotid *body* is a chemoreceptor

**Venous pressure** is monitored by **low-pressure** stretch receptors:

* Respond to increased venous return
* Are inhibited by positive pressure ventilation
* Act by stretch and typically described as **volume receptors**
* Are located in the:
    * **Atrial walls**
    * **SVC and IVC**
    * **Pulmonary circulation**

## Baroreceptor Control

Afferent fibres from CNIX and CNX travel to the NTS in the **medulla**. Effector neurons from the RVLM are GABAergic and therefore inhibitory, i.e. increased baroreceptor discharge *reduces* tonic sympathetic tone and increases vagal tone.

**Increased baroreceptor activity** therefore **results in**:

* Arterial and venous vasodilation
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Decreased cardiac output
* Decreased respiratory rate

Conversely, **increased** activity of **low-pressure** stretch receptors results in an **increase** rather than a decrease in **heart rate**.

## Baroreceptor Activity

Baroreceptors are:

* **More sensitive to pulsatile pressure** than constant pressure\
A decrease in pulse pressure without a change in MAP will decrease baroreceptor firing.
* Active throughout the cardiac cycle\
Rapid compensatory responses are vital in the short-term control of blood pressure, e.g. with posture.
* Active over the range from 50mmHg to 200mmHg

* This curve is left-shifted in children and neonates, and right-shifted in chronic hypertension, though this is reversible

## Hormonal control

Activation of atrial/ventricular stretch receptors stimulates ANP/BNP release respectively, which act to reduce blood pressure in the following ways:

* Increased GFR\
Act to constrict the efferent arteriole and dilates of the afferent arteriole. This subsequently inhibits renin secretion through increased hydrostatic pressure at the JGA and increased Na^+^ and Cl^-^ delivery to the macula densa.
* Decreased aldosterone\
Via inhibition of aldosterone secretion.
* Vasodilation\
Causes vasodilation of peripheral smooth muscle.
