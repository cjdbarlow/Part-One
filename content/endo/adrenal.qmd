# Adrenal Hormones

:::dual
Describe the control, secretions and functions of ~~renal and~~ adrenal hormones
:::

::: column-margin
This covers the production of adrenal hormones. Information specific to catecholamines receptor function can be found under [adrenoreceptors](adrenoreceptors.md), whilst detailed information on specific agents, including structure-activity relationships of catecholamines, is covered in the [pharmacopeia](adrenergic_drugs.md).

The adrenal glands are paired triangular glands at the superior pole of the kidney. The gland can be divided into:

* Adrenal cortex\
Consists of three layers which produce **steroid hormones** (A good mnemonic is GFR for the layers, and ACT(H) for hormones)
    * Zona Glomerulosa\
    Predominantly produces mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).
    * Zona Fasciculata\
    Predominantly produces glucocorticoids (cortisol).
    * Zona Reticularis\
    Predominantly produces sex steroids (testosterone).
* Adrenal medulla\
Produces catecholamines.

## Steroid Hormones

### Mineralocorticoids

**Aldosterone** is the key mineralocorticoid hormone, accounting for 95% of mineralocorticoid activity:

* Release is stimulated by:
    * ↑ Serum K^+^
    * ↑ Angiotensin II
        * Hypovolaemia
        * ↓ Osmolarity
    * ↑ ACTH
    * ↓ Serum pH
* Acts to increase sodium and water retention (and removal of potassium), via:
    * ↑ Expression and activation of Na^+^/K^+^ pumps on the basolateral membrane of DCT and CT cells, causing increased Na^+^ (and water) reabsorption and K^+^ elimination
    * Stimulation of the Na^+^/H^+^ pump in intercalated cells on the DCT

### Glucocorticoids

**Cortisol** (hydrocortisone) is the **primary endogenous glucocorticoid**, accounting for 95% of effect. Cortisol is:

* Produced at ~15-30mg.day^-1^
* Released in response to ACTH\
ACTH is released in response to CRH, which is:
    * Released in response to stress
    * Modulated by circadian rhythms, and demonstrates diurnal variation:
        * CRH peaks just before waking
        * CRH troughs during sleep

Cortisol has effects on many organ systems, and in **physiological** amounts cause:

Metabolic effects of cortisol are essentially anti-insulin effects.
:::


* CVS
    * ↑ Sensitivity to catecholamines
    * ↑ Fluid retention
* Metabolic\
    * Gluconeogenesis\
    To provide substrates, it also stimulates:
        * Proteolysis
        * Lipolysis
    * ↓ Glucose uptake

## Catecholamines

Naturally occurring catecholamines include:

* Adrenaline
* Noradrenaline
* Dopamine


Synthesis of catecholamines:

* Occurs in the **adrenal medulla**\
This is a **modified sympathetic ganglion** composed of **chromaffin cells**.
* Depends on **ACh release** by the presynaptic neuron\
Unlike many other hormones, catecholamine secretion does not exhibit a negative-feedback loop.
* Occurs as follows:
    * **Tyrosine** is concentrated in the adrenal medulla
    * Tyrosine is hydroxylated to DOPA by **tyrosine hydroxylase**\
    This is the **rate-limiting** step, and is probably the best enzyme to remember.
    * DOPA is decarboxylated to dopamine
    * Dopamine is converted to noradrenaline
    * Noradrenaline is converted to adrenaline by **PNMT** (Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase)\
    This may only occur in the adrenal medulla.


Plasma half-lives of noradrenaline and adrenaline are small as a consequence of their metabolism and elimination.

* Extraneuronal uptake in the lungs, liver, kidney, and GIT
* Neuronal uptakeby sympathetic nerve endings
* Inactivation by MAO in nerve cytoplasm
* Inactivation by COMT in the liver and kidney
