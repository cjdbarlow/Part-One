# Control of Blood Glucose

>Explain the control of blood glucose

Normal blood glucose in the non-diabetic is 4-6 mmol.L^-1^, though will rise after consumption of carbohydrate. Glucose regulation can be divided into:

* Short-term\
Regulation via secretion or inhibition of insulin and glucagon from the pancreatic islets.
* Long-term\
Regulation via both neuronal (SNS activation) and hormonal (cortisol, GH) mechanisms.

## Hormonal Mechanisms

### Short Term

Glucose levels are sensed directly in the pancreas and will result in insulin release when the **BGL is >5.6** mmol.L^-1^. **Pancreatic B cells** respond directly to glucose by secreting insulin in a biphasic fashion:

* An initial, rapid increase in release\
    * **Glucose enters** via the GLUT-2 transporter, and is converted to pyruvate which enters **the citric acid cycle** and produces ATP
    * ATP **inhibits** ATP-sensitive **K^+^ channels**, reducing K^+^ efflux and **causing depolarisation**
    * Depolarisation causes **Ca^2+^ release**, resulting in **exocytosis** of insulin granules
* A prolonged, slow increase in release
    * Glutamate is produced as a by-product of the citric acid cycle
    * Glutamate stimulates maturation of other insulin granules
    * Release of these granules causes the second phase of insulin release

Conversely, a low glucose level stimulates secretion of glucagon. This is typically less important than the effect of insulin unless in situations of starvation or severe physiological stress.

### Long Term

Sustained hypoglycaemia increases fat utilisation and decreases glucose utilisation (limiting further drops in blood glucose), via stimulating release of:

* GH
* Cortisol

## Neuronal Mechanisms

**Hypoglycaemia directly stimulates the hypothalamus**, causing:

* Increased SNS tone\
**Adrenaline** release in turn stimulates hepatic glucose release.

## Organ Effects

Glucose levels are influenced by the:

* Liver\
Insulin and glucagon act on the liver to continually adjust the relative rates of glycogenolysis and glycogenesis, allowing it to function as an effective **buffer** of **blood glucose**.
    * Hepatic disease significantly limits the efficacy of this system, and results in a widely-fluctuating blood glucose level
* Kidney\
    * A transient glycosuria may be seen as hyperglycaemia decreases renal absorption of glucose


## Physiological Responses to Hypoglycaemia


|BSL (mmol.L^-1^) |Symptoms|Endocrine Response|
|--|--|--|
|4.6||Insulin secretion inhibited|
|3.8|Autonomic dysfunction|Glucagon, adrenaline, and GH secretion|
|2.8|CNS dysfunction||
|2.2|Lethargy, Coma||
|1.7|Convulsions||
|0.6|Permanent brain damage, Death|||
