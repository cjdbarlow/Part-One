## Insulin

Insulin is a **polypeptide** hormone, and is:

* Synthesised from **proinsulin** in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of **B cells** in the **Islets of Langerhans**
* Excreted via exocytosis in response to an increase in intracellular Ca^2+^
* **Minimally protein bound** with a **tiny volume of distribution**\
V~D~ 0.075 L.kg^-1^, increased to 0.146 L.kg^-1^ in diabetics.
* **Metabolised** in liver, muscle, and kidney **by glutathione insulin transhydrogenase**, with renal elimination of inactive metabolites\
Circulatory **half-life** of **~5min**.


### Actions of Insulin

Insulin binds to a specific insulin receptor (a membrane-spanning protein composed of α and β subunits)  on the cell membrane. The complex is internalised, and its effects are mediated by tyrosine kinase.

Note that cells do not require insulin to take up glucose. GLUT~1~ receptors allow free entry of glucose into cells via facilitated diffusion; i.e. **Metabolism drives glucose uptake**.

Active transport of insulin in fat and muscle leads to triglyceride and glycogen production, respectively. Incidentally, the **hyperglycaemia** seen in **diabetes** is due **uninhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis**, and the acidosis due to uninhibited hepatic ketogenesis.
:::

### Glucose Tolerance

Hyperglycaemia occurs in diabetes due to **decreased peripheral utilisation** as glucose uptake is reduced due to absence of or resistance to insulin. In addition, the suppressive effect of insulin on hepatic gluconeogenesis is absent or reduced. 

## Glucagon

Glucagon is a **polypeptide** hormone, and is:

* Synthesised in the **A cells** of the pancreas
* Has a circulating **half-life** of **~5min**
* Metabolised predominantly in the liver\
Secreted directly into the portal vein, and **undergoes first-pass metabolism** resulting in low circulating levels.

## Somatostatin

Somatostatin is a **polypeptide** hormone that:

* Inhibits secretion pancreatic polypeptides including insulin and glucagon
* May function as a neurotransmitter in the CNS
