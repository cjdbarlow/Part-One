# Adaptive Immunity

>Describe the factors involved in the process of inflammation and the immune 
response, including innate and acquired immunity

The adaptive immune system responds to an exposure, demonstrating **specificity** and **memory**, with improved efficacy on repeat exposure.

Adaptive immunity may be:

* **Active**\
    Primary immune response generated by exposure to antigen.
    * Infection
    * Vaccination\
    An inactive (but still foreign and therefore antigenic) protein component of a pathogen is given to the patient, resulting in an immune response. Subsequent exposure to the whole pathogen triggers a secondary immune response.
* **Passive**\
    Preformed antibody is given to the patient. This will provide treatment/coverage for the life of the antibody, but immunity will be lost when the antibody breaks down or supplies are exhausted.
    * Transplacental
    * Colostrum
    * Administration of serum

Components of the active immune system include:

* **Cellular**\
Predominantly T lymphocytes
* **Humoral**\
Including complement and antibody.

## Adaptive Cellular Immunity

Lymphocytes are divided into two types:

* **B lymphocytes**\
Are produced in the bone marrow, and migrate to lymphoid (nodes, spleen, MALT) where they are renamed **plasma cells** and produce antibody. Functions include:
    * Production of antibody against specific antigens
    * Presentation of antigen to T-cells to active them
    * Proliferation to form memory cells


* **T lymphocytes**\
Are produced in the bone marrow and migrate to the thymus where they mature. T cells which express antibody to host protein apoptose, resulting in only 2% of immature T cells surviving. Mature T cells then spread to lymphoid tissue. There are five types of T cells, of which two are most important:
    * Helper T-cells\
    2/3^rds^ of T-cells are helper cells, are are identified by their **CD4** membrane protein. Functions include:
        * Cytokine production
        * B lymphocyte stimulation
        * Macrophage activation
    * Cytotoxic T-cells\
    Are identified by their **CD8** membrane protein. Functions include:
        * Destruction of virally infected and tumour cells\
        All cells **express proteins** that they are producing **on membrane MHC I molecules**, for inspection by immune cells. Infected or tumour cells will express foreign proteins, and cause activation of cytotoxic T cells:
            * **Induce apoptosis** in the target cell
            * **Rapid division** of cytotoxic T cell, which then inspects other cells for infection
        * Transformation to memory cells

## Adaptive Humoral Immunity

Antibodies Y-shaped immunoglobulins which:

* Are produced in response to a pathogen
* Are specific to that pathogen

Antibody functions include:

* **Opsonisation**\
* **Agglutination**\
Each antibody can bind multiple pathogens, increasing target size for leukocytes.
* **Inactivation of pathogen**\
Antibody binding may disable the pathogen.
* **Activation of complement**\
Antibody-antigen complexes cause complement activation.

### Primary Immune Response

The process of invasion of a new pathogen to antibody production takes ~5 days, and occurs in a number of steps:

* APC phagocytose a pathogen\
APCs include macrophages and dendritic cells.
* APC express antigen (bits of pathogen) on cell surface
* APC travel to lymphoid tissue and present it to B and T cells
* When an APC finds a B and T cell with a reciprocal antibody:
    * T helper cell becomes activated by APC
    * T helper cell rapidly proliferates ('clonal expansion')
        * Proportion become memory cells
    * B cells are activated by both the **APC *and* a T-helper cell** (requires both)
    * B cells rapidly proliferate
        * Proportion become memory cells
        * Proportion become **plasma cells**
            * Plasma cells produce antibody at a rate of 2000 molecules per *second*, which overrides normal cellular homeostasis, causing death within a week.
            * Antibody produced in a primary immune response is IgM, with some IgG produced later on.

### Secondary Immune Response

Repeat invasion by the same pathogen is met with a much more rapid and aggressive immune response:

* APCs phagocytose a pathogen
* APCs express and present antigen
* Memory T and Memory B cells formed during the primary response are activated, and begin rapidly dividing and producing antibody
