# Inflammation

:::CICM
Describe the factors involved in the process of inflammation and the immune response~~, including innate and acquired immunity~~
:::

Inflammation is a non-specific response triggered by a pathogen or tissue injury, which aims to limit further tissue damage.

Inflammation is classically characterised by:

* **Pain**
* **Heat**
* **Redness**
* **Swelling**
* **Loss of function**

This is a consequence of:

* **Vasodilation**\
↑ Blood flow to area, which increases supply of immune cells and resources for cellular repair.
* **↑** Vascular **permeability**\
↑ Extravasation of protein and immune cells.
* Migration of phagocytes\
Remove pathogens and cellular debris.

## Process of Inflammation

* Tissue damage\
    * Trauma causes mechanical disruption of vasculature and mast cell degranulation, causing local inflammation and activation of haemostatic mechanisms
    * Infection stimulates degranulation of local macrophages, releasing inflammatory cytokines and triggering mast cell degranulation
* Local inflammatory response\
    * Histamine causes arteriolar and post-capillary venule dilatation and subsequent extravasation
    * Release of chemotactic molecules attracts circulating inflammatory cells
* Systemic inflammatory response\
Severe inflammation may lead to cytokines in the systemic circulation, causing:
    * Fever
    * Neutrophil recruitment from bone marrow
    * Release of acute-phase proteins from liver
