# Endocrine Functions of the Kidney
>Outline the endocrine functions of the kidney

The kidney is involved in a number of endocrine processes and produces or metabolises a number of hormones:
* RAAS
* Vitamin D
* EPO
* Prostaglandins

## Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System {#raas}
The RAAS is a signaling pathway involved in blood pressure control. It involves a number of hormones:

<img src="\resources\angiotensin.svg">

* **Angiotensinogen** is produced by the liver in response to:
     * Glucocorticoids
     * Thyroid hormones
     * Oestrogens
     * Angiotensin II
     * Various inflammatory proteins


* **Renin** is a protease produced by the kidneys in response to Î²<sub>1</sub> stimulation or hypotension, and exists to **cleave angiotensinogen** to **angiotensin I**

* **ACE** cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and also cleaves bradykinin into inactive metabolites


* **Angiotensin II** increases blood pressure via a number of mechanisms:
    * Simulates **aldosterone release** from the adrenal cortex, increasing sodium and water retention
    * **Vasoconstriction of efferent greater than the afferent arterioles**  
    Results in slight decrease in GFR at a lower perfusion pressure, but increases filtration fraction.  
        * NB: Different sources quote different changes (increase or decrease) in GFR  
        The final effect may vary depending on the contribution of other autoregulatory processes.
    * **Reduces K<sub>f</sub>** through constriction of glomerular mesangial cells
    * Increased SNS activity and **central and peripheral vasoconstriction**
    * **Increases thirst** via hypothalamic stimulation
    * Stimulates **ADH release**, reducing renal water excretion
    * Stimulates release of angiotensinogen


* **Aldosterone** acts on the distal convoluted tubule to:
    * Increase reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and water
    * Increase elimination of K<sup>+</sup> and H<sup>+</sup>
        
    

##Vitamin D
Vitamin D has a complex metabolic pathway which meanders through a number of organ systems:
* Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may be absorbed in diet or produced in skin by the action of UV light on 7-dehydrocholesterol
* Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is then hydrolysed in the liver by CYP450 enzymes to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OHD<sub>3</sub>)
* 25-OHD<sub>3</sub> is then converted in the proximal tubule to calcitriol - the active form


##Erythropoietin {#epo}
Erythropoiesis is stimulated by EPO release:
* In adults, EPO is released from the:
  * Peritubular capillary fibroblasts (85%)
  * Liver (15%)
* EPO is released in response to:
    * Hypoxia
    * Hypotension
    * Low Hct
* Erythropoiesis is inhibited by:  
    * High red cell volume
    * Renal failure  
    Production of EPO is decreased in renal failure, which is why patients with end-stage renal disease require exogenous EPO.
