>Understanding the adverse consequences of blood transfusion, including that of  massive blood transfusion

##Production and Storage of Blood Products
Red cells, platelets, and FFP have different storage requirements.

###Red Blood Cells
* Stored blood decays over time - this is known as a **storage lesion**  
Preservatives are used to extend the time blood can be stored:
    *  Kept at ~4°C (balance between freezing and being too warm)
        * Reduces cellular metabolic requirement
        * Inhibits bacterial growth
    * Collected in an aseptic fashion
    * Stored in special solutions:
      * SAGM is currently used by the Australian Red Cross:
          * Saline
          * Adenine  
          Substrate for ATP synthesis
          * Glucose  
          Substrate for RBC glycolysis
          * Mannitol
      * CPDA1 (citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine) was traditionally used
          * Citrate binds calcium, preventing clotting
          * Phosphate acts as a buffer and phosphate source for metabolism
          * Dextrose 
          * Adenine 


* A **storage lesion** describes the changes that occur in stored blood:
    * Loss of 2,3 DPG  
    Less of a factor in CPDA1 blood.
    * Haemolysis
    * Hyperkalaemia  
    Typically not clinically relevant as potassium is taken up into red cells when metabolism resumes.
    * Acidaemia
    * Hyponatraemia  
    Not clinically significant.


* Blood can be stored for up to 35 days, which corresponds to 70% survival

###Platelets
Platelets require particular storage conditions to remain functional:
* Temperature ~22°C  
Below this, platelets deform and become non-functional
* Gas exchange  
Platelets are stored in a bag which allows gas exchange to occur, minimising lactic acid and carbon dioxide production
* Agitation  
Platelets are stored on an agitator which prevents clotting and ensures the platelets are well mixed, which maximises the diffusion gradient for gas exchange
* pH control  
pH is kept between 6.2 to 7.8 to prevent degranulation.

As platelets do not contain antigen, there is not a *strict* requirement for platelets to be type matched. However:
* Rh(+) platelets should be avoided in Rh(-) patients  
The small amount of contaminanting red cells may precipitate rhesus disease.
* Plasma incompatibility should be avoided as this may lead to haemolysis of recipient red cells
    * Children are at greater risk due to their proportionally smaller blood volume

###Fresh Frozen Plasma
Fresh Frozen Plasma is:
* Prepared either via:
    * Separation from whole blood
    * Apheresis  
    Removal of a large volume (typically 800ml) of plasma from a single patient, with return of red cells to the donor.
* Once collected, it is frozen and rethawed in a water bath prior to use

###Cryoprecipitate
Cryoprecipitate is prepared by removing the precipitate from FFP which forms at 1–6°C. Cryoprecipitate:
* Contains predominantly:
    * Fibrinogen
    * Fibronectin
    * vWF
    * Factor VIII
    * Factor XII
    

###Whole Blood
Whole blood undergoes additional changes:
* White cells become nonfunctional within 4-6 hours of collection, though antigenic properties remain
* Platelets become non-functional within 48 hours of storage at 4°C
* Factor levels decrease significantly after 21 days


##Blood Groups
Blood groups refer to the expression of surface antigens by red blood cells, as well as any antibody in plasma. Blood groups can be divided into three types:
* ABO
* Rhesus
* Other antibodies
These are additional antibodies that a patient may express in plasma, and include Kell, Lewis, Duffy, etc.

###ABO
The ABO blood group is:
* A complex carbohydrate-based antigens series  
These may be either A or B antigen, and patients may express one, both, or neither, giving four blood groups (A, B, AB, O).
* Expressed on the **H-antigen stem** of RBCs, and on the surface of tissue cells.
    * The **Bombay Blood Group** (or **hh** or **Oh** group) describes individuals who do not express the H antigen  
    These individuals:
        * Don't express A- or B-antigen (as there is no H-antigen stem) and are 'universal donors'
        * Express H-antibody  
        Can only receive blood from other individuals with the Bombay phenotype
* Individuals express IgM antibody to foreign blood groups  
    This develops within 6 months of birth, likely due to environmental exposure to similar antigens.
* Associated with a severe hypersensitivity reaction if an ABO-mismatch occurs

|Group|RBC|Plasma|
|--|--|
|A|A-antigen|B-antibody|
|B|B-antigen|A-antibody|
|O|-|A-antibody <br> B-antibody
|AB|A-antigen <br> B-antigen|-|

###Rhesus
The Rhesus blood group is the next most important group after ABO. The Rhesus system:
* Consists of ~50 different antigens, the most important of which is **D**  
Rhesus status is therefore expressed as positive (D - 85% of the population) or negative (anything-but-D).
* Rhesus antibody does not naturally occur in Rh(-) individuals  
    * This is relevant in Rhesus disease  
    A Rh(-) mother exposed to Rh(+) blood will develop Anti-D antibody, which can cross placenta and induce abortion in a future Rh(+) foetus. This can occur with:
        * Incompatible transfusion
        * Foetal-materal haemorrhage  

##Compatibility Testing
Donor blood must be tested with recipient blood to avoid a transfusion reaction. This involves three processes:
* Blood Typing (ABO/Rh)  
Blood is typed by mixing it in vitro with plasma (and plasma with erythrocytes) of known groups (containing IgM antibody (Anti-A, Anti-B, Anti-AB)), and observing for agglutination.
* Antibody Screen  
For other antibodies.
    * Testing is similar to ABO screening, except *plasma* is mixed with red cells containing known antigen (e.g. Kell, Duffy), and monitored for agglutination.
* Cross-match  
  Involves two processes:
    * Saline test  
    Erythrocytes are suspended in saline and mixed with antibodies at room temperature, monitoring for agglutination.
        * This confirms ABO type
    * Indirect Coomb's test  
    Identifies IgG antibody in host plasma which would cause haemolysis of transfused red cells. This is typically no longer done, as it offers negligible extra safety over the above processes. Doing it involves:
        * Incubating  
        Binds IgG Ab to antigen on RBC membrane.
        * Washing  
        Removes serum and unbound IgG.
        * Testing with an antibody *to* IgG, known as antiglobulin serum.
            * A positive test will cause clumping of red cells, as each antiglobulin serum will bind two IgG molecules, which have in turn been bound to red cells
            * A negative test will cause no agglutination, as the IgG has not been bound to red cells
                * If negative, the antiglobulin serum is re-used on a control sample to ensure that it is not a false negative



##Transfusion Reactions
Transfusion reactions can be classified as either acute (< 24 hours) or delayed (> 24 hours), and as immunological or non-immunological.

###Immunological Acute Reactions

|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|ABO Mismatch|1:40,000|ABO incompatibility causing rapid intravascular haemolysis, which may cause chest pain, jaundice, shock, and DIC. RhD-reactions tend to cause extravascular haemolysis.
|Haemolytic (acute)|1:76,000 (1:1.8 million fatal)|Immunological destruction of transfused cells (Type II hypersensitivity). Presents with fever, tachycardia, pain, progressing to distributive shock|
|Febrile, non-haemolytic|~1:100|Cytokine release from stored cells causing a mild inflammatory reaction, with temperature rising to ≥38ºC or ≥1ºC above baseline (if >37ºC). Benign - but requires exclusion of a haemolytic reaction.
|Urticaria|1:100|Hypersensitivity to plasma proteins in the transfused unit
|Anaphylaxis|1:20,000|Type I hypersensitivity reaction to plasma protein in transfused uni
|TRALI|Variable|Donor plasma HLA activate recipient leukocyte antigen activating pulmonary neutrophils, causing fever, shock, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema

###Non-Immunological Acute Reactions
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Massive Transfusion Complications|Variable|See below
|Non-immune mediated haemolysis|Rare|Due to physicochemical damage to RBCs (freezing, device malfunction). May lead to haemoglobinuria, haemoglobinaemia, tachycardia and fevers.
|Sepsis|1:75,000 (platelets), 1:500,000 (RBC)|Contamination during collection or processing. Most common organisms are those which use iron as a nutrient and reproduce at low temperatures, e.g. *Yersinia Pestis*.
|Transfusion Related Circulatory Overload (TACO)|< 1:100|Rapid increase in intracellular volume in patients with poor circulatory compliance or chronic anaemia. May result in pulmonary oedema and be confused with TRALI.

###Delayed Immunological Reaction
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction|1:2,500|Development of sensitisation with the reaction occurring 2-14 days after a single exposure. Typically Kidd, Duffy, Kell antibodies.
|Post-tranfusion Purpura|Rare|Alloimmunisation to Human Platelet Antigen causing sudden self-limiting thrombocytopenia
|TA-GVHD|Rare|Transfused lymphocytes recognise host HLA as positive causing marrow aplasia, with mortality >90%
|Alloimmunisation| 1:100 (RBC antigens), 1:10 (HLA antigens)|Previous sensitisation leading to  antibody production on re-exposure.
|Transfusion-related Immune Modulation|Not known|Transient immunosuprression following transfusion potentially due to cytokine release from leukocytes

###Delayed Non-Immunological Reaction
|Reaction|Incidence|Mechanism|
|--------|---------|---------|
|Iron Overload|Chelation after 10-20 units, organ dysfunction 50-100 units|Each unit of PRBC contains ~250mg of iron, whilst average excretion is 1mg.day<sup>-1</sup>.


##Complications of Massive Transfusion
A **massive transfusion** is one where:
* Greater than **one-half** of **circulating volume** in **4 hours**
* Whole **circulating volume** in **24 hours**


Risk of complication from a massive transfusion is influenced by:
* Number of units
* Rate of transfusion
* Patient factors

|Complication|Mechanism|
|------|-----------|
|Air embolism|Inadvertant infusion
|Hypothermia|Cooled products
|Hypocalcaemia|Consumption with coagulopathy and bound to citrate added to transfused units
|Hypomagnesaemia|Bound to citrate in transfused units
|Citrate toxicity|Citrate is added to stored units as an anticoagulant
|Lactic acidosis|Hyperlactataemia due to anaerobic metabolism in stored units
|Hyperkalaemia|Potassium migratrates from stored erythrocytes into plasma whilst in storage
