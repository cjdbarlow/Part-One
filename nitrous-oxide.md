|Property|Nitrous Oxide|
|--|--|
|**Pharmaceutics**|Non-flammable but supports combustion. Produced by heating ammonium nitrate to 250°C. Potential contaminants include NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and HNO<sub>3</sub>.<br><br> **Stored as a liquid**, such that the gauge pressure is only accurate when all remaining N<sub>2</sub>O is in the gaseous phase.<br><br> The **filling ratio** is the mass of N<sub>2</sub>O in the cylinder compared to the mass of water it could hold, and is **0.75** in temperate regions, and **0.67** in warmer regions.
|**Molecular Weight**|44|
|**Boiling point**|-88°C|
|**Critical Temperature/Pressure**|36.5°C / 72 bar| 
|**SVP** (at 20°C)|39,000 mmHg
|**Blood:gas coefficient**|0.47|
|**Oil:gas coefficient**|1.4|
|**MAC**|105 (MAC awake 68)|
|**Mechanism of Action**|Several different mechanisms, including:<br>- Stimulates dynorphin release (acts at KOP receptor) <br>- Positive allosteric modulator at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor<br>- NMDA antagonist|
|**Metabolism**|< 0.01% hepatic reduction.|
|**Resp**|Diffusion hypoxia due to second gas effect. Small ↓ in V<sub>T</sub>, ↑ in RR such that MV is unchanged.|
|**CVS**|↑ SNS tone, mild myocardial depression. ↑ PVR - beware in pulmonary hypertension.|
|**CNS**|Powerful analgesic when > 20%, via endorphin and encephalin modulation, and on opioid receptors. ↑ CBF. Loss of consciousness common at 80%. 1.4x relative risk of PONV|
|**GU**|Not tocolytic - useful adjuvant in GA caesarian section to reduce volatile anaesthetic use
|**GIT**|Expansion|
|**Metabolic**|↑ Homocysteine.|
|**Toxic Effects**|More soluble than N<sub>2</sub> means it will rapidly diffuse into air-filled cavities, increasing the volume of compliant cavities (PTHx, bowel), and increasing the pressure of non-compliant cavities (middle ear). <br><br> Prolonged use (> 6 hours) **oxidates cobalt ion in vitamin B<sub>12</sub>**, **preventing its action as a cofactor** for **methionine synthetase**, preventing DNA synthesis. This leads to: <br>- Megaloblastic changes in bone marrow <br>- Agranulocytosis<br>- Peripheral neuropathy <br>- Possible teratogenicity - avoid in early pregnancy <br><br> Greenhouse gas.|

##Entonox

Entonox is a 50/50 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen, used as analgesia in labor and minor procedures.

|Property|Entonox (50% O<sub>2</sub>, 50% N<sub>2</sub>O)
|--|--|
|**Pharmaceutics**| The gases dissolve each other and behave differently than would be expected from their individual properties. This is the **Poynting effect**.
|**Critical Temperature/Pressure**| *Pseudo*critical temperature of **-7°C**, below which it will separate into **liquid** 50% N<sub>2</sub>O (with some dissolved O<sub>2</sub>), and gaseous O<sub>2</sub>. This is most likely to occur at 117 bar, and can lead to delivery of a hypoxic mixture. <br><br> Delivery of a hypoxic mix is prevented by: <br>-Storing cylinders horizontally (↑ area for diffusion)<br> Storing cylinders at temperatures > 5°C <br>-Using a dip tube so that liquid 50% N<sub>2</sub>O is used before the gaseous mixture
