> Define the thermoneutral zone, and describe the mechanisms by which normal body temperature is maintained.

* Regulation of body temperature is done by **balancing heat loss and heat production**, predominantly through behavioural mechanisms and skin
* The body is able to maintain a relatively constant core temperature under a wide range of environmental conditions
  * The **thermoneutral zone** is the range across which the basal rate heat production (and oxygen consumption) is balanced by the rate of heat loss
    * For an adult it is **typically 27-31°C**
    * In neonates it is higher, **typically 32-34°C**.

##Principles
Net flux of heat is determined by the balance of metabolic heat production and the contribution of four mechanisms of heat loss:
* **Radiation**
* **Conduction**
* **Convection**
* **Evaporation**

###Radiative
Radiative heat exchange:
* Describes the loss of heat through EMR by all objects above 0°K  
  * Radiative heat loss is proportional to temperature
  * Radiative heat loss does not require a transfer medium
* Makes up ~45% of heat loss under thermoneutral conditions.
* Depends on the temperature differential between an individual and their environmen
  * A cold environment (e.g. operating theatre) causes a large radiant heat loss  
  The heat loss from the patient is greater than the heat gain from the surrounding environment.

###Conduction
**Conduction** is the **transfer of heat (as kinetic energy) by direct contact** from a higher temperature object to the lower temperature one. Conduction:
* Requires physical contact between bodies to conduct heat
  * Solids conduct heat better than gases
  * There is no conduction in a vacuum
* Heat loss via conduction is minimal in air but is a major cause of heat loss in immersion  
  * As arteries and veins typically run next to each other, arterial heat tends to be transferred to the (cooler) veins, limiting further heat loss  
  This is similar to counter-current exchange in the kidney.
* As fat is a poorer conductor of heat than muscle, increased body fat will slow heat loss by conduction

###Convection
**Convection** is loss of heat by conduction by a moving object. Convection is:
* The predominant mechanism of heat loss in the naked human  
Effects are greater effects at higher wind speeds.

###Evaporation
**Evaporative losses** describe the loss of heat energy due to the latent heat of vaporisation of water. Evaporation of 100ml of water will reduce body temperature by ~1°C.

##Temperature Sensation and Regulation
Temperature sensors are **central** and **peripheral**, whilst **regulation** occurs centrally. 

###Central sensation
Central temperature sensors exist in the:
* Abdomial viscera
* Spinal cord
* Hypothalamus  
**Anterior hypothalamus** is the most important central thermoreceptor, and responds to  both increased and decreased temperatures by **altering their rate of depolarisation**, eliciting an array of neuronal and hormonal responses.
* Brainstem  

The **interthreshold range** is the range of core temperatures not triggering a response.
* Normal is 0.2 to 0.4°C.
* Widens under anaesthesia to ~4°C


###Peripheral sensation
Peripheral temperature sensors are:
* **Free nerve endings**
* Extremely sensitive  
Alter their rates of firing by orders of magnitude in response to temperature change.
* Divided into:
  * **Cold receptors**  
  Lie beneath the epidermis, and are excited by cooling (inhibited by warming), active from 10-40°C, with a static maxima at 25°C.
  * **Warm receptors**  
  Lie deep to the dermis, are excited by warming (and inhibited by cooling), active from 30-50°C, with a static maxima at 44°C.


###Regulation
Temperature sensation runs from cutaneous receptors via the spinothalamic tracts and medulla to the hypothalamus. Cortical input is received via the thalamocortical relay, whilst primitive responses are effected via the midbrain.

##Effector Reponses
|  | Increase heat loss | Reduce heat loss/Increase heat gain |
| -- | -- | -- |
| CNS | Remove clothing, sprawl, reduce activity. | Huddle, seek shelter, add clothing |
| Cardiovascular | Increase peripheral vasodilation and AV shunting, and cardiac output to improve flow to cutaneous tissues | Vasoconstriction, peripheral circulatory shut down |
| Musculocutaneous | Sweating | Piloerection, Shivering |
| Metabolic |  | Increased BMR, non-shivering thermogenesis |

* **Vascular changes** are **the least metabolically costly** and can result in dramatic increases (up to 60% of cardiac output) in skin blood flow
* When environmental temperature exceeds body temperature, conduction and convection result in heat gain - **evaporative cooling via sweating** is the only way to reduce body temperature
* Efficacy of sweating is related to **relative humidity**

* Piloerection (hair standing on end) traps a layer of warm air close to the body to act as an insulator  
This is of more importance in other primates than in man, as they have enough body hair to make it effective. 


* Increasing basal metabolic rate and 'waste' heat production is essential to maintain temperature in cold environments. This can be through:
  * Shivering  
    The simultaneous contraction of agonistic and antagonistic muscles.
  * Non-shivering thermogenesis:
    * Hormonal  
    Levels of thyroid hormone and adrenaline increase, raising metabolic rate in all cells
    * Brown fat  
    Brown fat produces heat through **uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation**, which uses the electron transport chain to produce heat rather than ATP. Brown fat is:
      * A vital mechanism for heat production in the **neonate** (they have an **immature shivering response**), and forms ~5% of neonatal mass
      * Located in:
        * Neck
        * Supraclavicular
        * Interscapula
        * Suprarenal
      * Sympathetically innervated  
      Contains large numbers of β<sub>3</sub> receptors

##Effect of Anaesthesia{#anaes}
General anaesthesia causes a 1-3°C drop in core body temperature, which occurs in three phases:
*  Rapid reduction  
Core temperature falls by 1-1.5°C in the first 30 minutes.
  * Predominantly due to vasodilation, which is due to:  
    * Reduction in SVR, with generalised vasodilation and increased skin blood flow  
    Heat redistribution is the major initial factor (rather than heat loss), as vasodilation leads to increased heat content of peripheries.
    * Impairs thermoregulatory vasoconstrictive responses  
    Interthreshold range is widened to 4°C (up from 0.4°C) 
* Gradual reduction  
Further drop in core temperature of 1°C over following 2-3 hours.  
  * Due to heat loss exceeding heat production  
  Non-shivering thermogenesis is the only response available to paralysed, anaesthetised patient.
* Plateau  
Once core body temperature falls far enough, thermoregulatory responses are activated and further heat loss is attenuated by increased metabolic heat production.

Neuraxial anaesthesia:
* Hypothermia is less extreme as thermoregulation is only affected in areas covered by the blockade
* Plateau does not occur as vasoconstrictive responses are inhibited by the blockade
