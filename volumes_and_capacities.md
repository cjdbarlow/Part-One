The lung has four volumes and four (main) capacities:
* A **volume** is measured directly
* A **capacity** is a **sum of volumes**

##Volumes
* **Tidal volume** (V<sub>T</sub>)   
Volume of air during normal, quiet breathing.
  * Normal is **7ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>**, or 500ml


* **Inspiratory reserve volume** (IRV)  
Volume of air that can be inspired **above tidal volume**.
  * Normal is 4515ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>, or **2500ml**


* **Expiratory reserve volume** (ERV)  
Volume of air that can be expired following tidal expiration.
  * Normal is 15ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>, or **1500ml**


* **Residual volume** (RV)  
Volume of air in the lungs following a maximal expiration.
  * Normal is 15-20ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>, or **1500ml**

##Capacities
* **Functional Residual Capacity** (FRC)  
FRC = RV + ERV.
  * Normal is **30ml.kg<sup>-1</sup>** or 3000ml
  * FRC decreases 20% when supine, and a further 20% under general anaesthesia


* **Vital Capacity** (VC)  
VC = ERV + V<sub>T</sub> + IRV.  
  * Normal is 4500ml


* **Inspiratory Capacity** (IC)  
IC = V<sub>T</sub> + IRV.
  * Normal is 3000ml


* **Total Lung Capacity** (TLC)  
TLC = RV + ERV + V<sub>T</sub> + IRV.
  * Normal is 6000ml

###Functional Residual Capacity
The FRC has many important physiological functions:

* **Gas exchange**  
The FRC allows blood in the pulmonary circulation to become oxygenated throughout the respiratory cycle (if there was no FRC, then at expiration the lungs would be empty and no oxygenation would occur).

* **Oxygen Reserve**  
FRC is the only clinically modifiable oxygen store in the body, and allows continual oxygenation of blood during apnoeic periods.



* **Minimise Work of Breathing**  
Work of breathing is a function of lung resistance and compliance.
  * The lung sits on the **steepest** part of the **compliance occurs** at FRC  
  **Compliance is optimised** as:
    * Alveoli are open and minimally distended
      * Below FRC, some alveoli collapse and the volume of lung available to receive the tidal volume decreases  
      Re-expansion of collapsed alveoli requires more work than expanding open alveoli.
      * Above FRC, some alveoli will become overdistended and their compliance will fall
  * **Airway resistance decreases** as airway radius increases as lung volume increases


* **Minimise RV Afterload**  
PVR is minimal at FRC.
  * Above FRC, compression of intra-alveolar vessels occurs and PVR increases
  * Below FRC, extra-alveolar vessels collapse and PVR increases


* **Maintain lung volume above closing capacity**  
If closing capacity (see below) exceeds FRC, then shunt will occur.



Factors affecting FRC:
* FRC is reduced by:
  * Supine positioning  
  Falls by ~20%.
  * Anaesthesia  
  Falls by ~20%.
  * Raised intra-abdominal pressure
  * Impaired lung and chest wall compliance
* FRC is increased by:
  * PEEP
    * Extrinsic
    * Intrinsic (gas trapping)
      * PEEP
  * Emphysema
  * Acute asthma
  * Age  
  May increase slightly.
 
 
 
##Measurement of Lung Volumes and Capacities
* ERV, V<sub>T</sub>, and IRV can all be measured directly using spirometry  
  * A **spirometer** is a flow meter
    * The patient exhales as fast as possible through the flow meter
    * A flow-time curve is produced
    * This curve can be integrated to find volume
* Any capacity which is a sum of these (IC, VC) can therefore be calculated


* RV **cannot** be measured by spirometry, as it can't be exhaled
  * Therefore FRC and TLC cannot be calculated
* RV can be measured using:
  * Gas dilution
  * Body plethysmography



###Gas Dilution
* Gas dilution relies on two principles:
  * Conservation of Mass
  * Helium has poor solubility and will not diffuse into circulation


* **Limitations** of gas dilution: 
  * Only gas communicating gas can be measured - will underestimate FRC in gas-trapping


* Method: 
  * Patient takes several breaths from a gas mixture containing a known concentration of helium (giving time for equilibration)
  * The concentration of expired helium is then measured  
  From the law of conservation of mass:  
  $$C_1V_1 = C_2V_2$$  
    * $$V_2$$ is equal to the volume of the gas mixture the patient was breathing from ($$V_1$$) and the patients FRC
    * Therefore:  
    $$C_1V_1 = C_2(V_1 + FRC)$$  
    $$FRC = V_1{C_1 - C_2 \over C_2}$$


 
###Body Plethysmography
* Body plethysmography relies on:
  * Boyles law  
  Pressure and volume are inversely proportional at a constant temperature, i.e. ($$P \times V = k$$).


* Method:
  * Patient is placed in a closed box, with a mouthpiece that exits the box
  * The patient inhales against a closed mouthpiece:
    * When the patient inhales, the volume of gas in the box decreases (the patient takes up more space) and therefore the pressure increases
    * The change in volume of the box is given by:  
    $$P_1V_1 = P_2V_2$$, where:
      * $$V_2$$ is the change in box volume, or $$V_1 - \Delta V$$
      * Therefore:  
      $$P_1V_1 = P_2(V_1 - \Delta V)$$  
      As $$\Delta V$$ is the only unknown value, it can be calculated.
    * The change in volume of the lung must be the same as the volume of the box ($$\Delta V$$)
      * In the case of the lung, the initial volume ($$V_1$$) is FRC
      * Therefore:  
       $$P_1 \times FRC = P_2(FRC + \Delta V)$$  
       $$FRC = {P_2 \Delta V \over P_3 - P_4}$$

##Closing Capacity
* Closing capacity is **volume at which small airways begin to close**  
Closing capacity is the sum of residual volume and closing volume.
  * Because dependent lung is compressed by gravity, dependent (typically basal) airways are of smaller calibre than non-dependent (typically apical) airways
  * During expiration, these airways are compressed first  
  Alveoli connected to these airways are isolated, and **V/Q scatter or shunt** occurs.
  * If **closing capacity exceeds FRC**, then airway closure occurs during normal tidal breathing  
  This occurs when:
    * FRC is decreased
    * CC is increased  
      * Increases with age  
        * CC exceeds FRC in the supine patient at 44
        * CC exceeds FRC in the erect patient at 66
  * This is clinically relevant during **preoxygenation**, as it will limit the denitrogenation that can occur

###Measurement of Closing Capacity
Closing capacity is measured using Fowlers Method, and is covered under [Dead Space](dead_space.md).
