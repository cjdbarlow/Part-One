# Tracheostomy
> Describe the anatomy relevant to the performance of a ~~naso, or endo, tracheal intubation, a cricothyroidotomy or~~ tracheostomy

##Trachea
The trachea is fibrocatilagenous tube which:
* Extends from the larynx superiorly to the Plane of Louis inferiorly
* Terminates by division into the right and left mainstem bronchi
* Runs at 15 degrees parallel to the surface of the neck, such that the distal trachea is deeper than the proximal trachea
* Has a D-shaped cross section  
    * Anterior wall is formed by 18-22 incomplete cartilaginous rings which maintain tracheal patency
    * Posterior wall of the trachea is spanned by longitudinal smooth muscle known as trachealis
* Is typically:
    * **10cm long**
    * **2.3cm wide**
    * **1.8cm in AP diameter**

###Relationships
* Lateral to the trachea are the:
    * Carotid sheaths  
    Contains the carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagal nerves.
    * Thyroid lobes (and inferior thyroid arteries)
    * Recurrent laryngeal nerves.
* Inferior to the thyroid isthmus lies the thyroid veins
* Posterior to the trachea are the:
    * Oesophagus
    * Vertebral column

##Surface Anatomy
Midline neck structures are relevant surface anatomy:
* Layngeal structures  
Including: Hyoid, thyroid cartilage, cricothyroid membrane, cricoid cartilage.
* Sternal notch
* Thyroid lobes  
Lie lateral to trachea.

##Layers of Dissection
* Skin
* Subcutaneous fat
* Superficial and Deep Pretracheal fascia
* Tracheal wall
    * Ideally between 1st and 2nd rings
