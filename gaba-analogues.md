#GABA Analogues

Gabapentin and pregabalin:
* Are both **structual analogues** of GABA
* Have no direct action on the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor
* **Act on the α<sub>2</sub>δ subunit of voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels** in the CNS, inhibiting neurotransmitter release
* May have some NMDA receptor activity

##Comparison of GABA Analogues
