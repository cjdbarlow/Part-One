# Toxic Alcohols {#id}

**Alcohols** include:
* **Ethanol**
* **Methanol**
* **Ethylene Glycol**

In toxicity:
* All present with symptoms of alcohol intoxication
* All contribute to the osmolar gap
* Different toxicities occur due to the different metabolites

##Ethanol
Ethanol is a weak alcohol with a complicated mechanism of action similar to volatile anaesthetic agents:
* Enhanced GABA-mediated inhibition  
This is **reversible with flumazenil**.
* Inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry
* Inhibition of NMDA function
* Inhibition of adenosine transport


|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Dosing**|One unit is ~8g/10ml of pure ethanol
|**Absorption**|Rapid PO absorption
|**Metabolism**|Saturatable kinetics at >4mmol.L<sup>-1</sup> due to high doses requiring extensive NAD<sup>+</sup> for oxidation, limiting metabolism to ~1 unit per hour. Low (0.2) extraction ratio, so high portal vein concentrations from rapid absorption (e.g. shots) causes a greater pharmacological effect. Ethanol is metabolised by **alcohol dehydrogenase** to acetylaldehyde, which is metabolised by aldehyde dehydrogenase to **acetyl CoA**.
|**Elimination**|10% eliminated unchanged in air and urine
|**Resp**|Respiratory depression
|**CVS**|Vasodilatation increasing heat loss, reduced cardiovascular disease mortality due to increased HDL and inhibition of platelets. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy in abuse.
|**CNS**|Slurred speech, intellectual impediment, motor impediment, euphoria, dysphoria, increased confidence. Dementia, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebellar atrophy with chronic use.
|**Endocrine**|Stimulates ACTH release and 'pseudo-Cushing's syndrome'. Inhibits testosterone release. May cause lactic acidosis and hypoglycaemia in toxicity.
|**Renal**|Inhibition of ADH release, causing diuresis. Ethanol is osmotically active and contributes to the **osmolar gap**.
|**GIT**|Gastritis. Fatty liver, progressing to hepatitis, necrosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis
|**GU**|Tocolytic effect
|**Haeme**|Inhibition of platelet aggregation
|**Metabolic**|High energy content comparble with fat (29kJ.g<sup>-1</sup>)
|**Other**|Synergistic with other CNS depressants. Metabolic interactions with warfarin, phenobarbitone, and steroids

##Methanol
* Metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to formaldehyde and then formic acid
* Formic acid is neurotoxic  
Damages retina and the optic nerve.

##Ethylene Glycol
* Metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycoaldehyde, and (via several intermediate steps) to oxalic acid
* Oxalic acid binds calcium, which causes:
  * Hypocalcaemia
    * Long QT
  * Acute renal failure
