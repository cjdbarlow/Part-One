# Non-Depolarising Neuromuscular Blockers

Non-depolarising NMBs are muscle relaxants used to:
*  Facilitate laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation
*  Control ICP
*  Improve respiratory system compliance
*  Improve patient safety on transportation

Mechanism of action is by competitive antagonism of ACh at the NMJ, preventing generation of end-plate potentials. Effective pharmacodynamic response requires >70% receptor occupation.

##Common Features of Neuromuscular Blockers
|Property|Action|
|--|--|
|**Route of Administration**| IV/IM|
|**Distribution**|Small V<sub>D</sub> as they are polar and unable to cross lipid membranes|
|**Elimination**|Reduced urinary clearance which prolongs the mechanism of action of aminosteroids in renal failure
|**Resp**|Apnoea|
|**MSK**|↑ Duration in hypothermia|
|**Renal**|↑ Duration in acidosis, ↑ duration in hypokalaemia, ↓ duration in hyperkalaemia, ↑ duration in hypermagnesaemia|
|**Metabolic**|Critical Illness Myopathy in patients with long-term relaxant use|

The ED<sub>95</sub> is:
* The dose of a neuromuscular blocking drug required to produce a 95% reduction in twitch height in 50% of the population
* A commonly-used therapeutic end-point for neuromuscular blocking drugs  
Typically, induction doses used are 2-5x the ED<sub>95</sub>.
