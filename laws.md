#Laws and Equations
This appendix is a list of the key laws and equations common to many topics:

##General Laws
* **Fick's Law of Diffusion**  
Diffusion of a substance across a membrane is given by:  
$$\dot{V} = {A \times D \times \Delta P \over T} $$ , where:
    * $$A$$ = Area of the sheet
    * $$D$$ = Diffusion constant, which is proportional to the **solubility** of the gas and inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight, i.e. $$ D \propto {Sol \over \sqrt{MW}}$$
    * $$T$$ = Thickness of the sheet



* **Hagan-Poiseuille Equation**  
Calculates the flow for a given pressure different of a particular fluid. May also be rearranged to calculate pressure or resistance.
    * Given by the equation:  
    $$ Q = {\pi P r^4 \over 8 v l} $$, where:
        * Q is the flow
        * P is the driving pressure
        * v is the dynamic viscosity
        * L is the length of tubing
        * r is the radius
    * Has several limitations:
        * Only models laminar flow
        * Fluid must be incompressible  
        Not technically valid for air, but provides a good approximation when used clinically.
        * Fluid must be Newtonian
        * Fluid must be in a cylindrical pipe of uniform cross-section


* **Reynolds Number**  
Reynolds Number is a dimensionless index used to predict the liklihood of turbulent flow. R<2000 is likely to be laminar, R>2000 is likely to be turbulent. Given by the equation:  
    $$ Reynolds \ Number = {2rvd \over n} $$, where:
        * v is the linear velocity of fluid in $$m/s$$
        * d is the fluid density in $$Pa S$$
        * r is the radius in $$m$$
        * n is the viscosity in $$m^2 / s$$


##Cell Physiology
* **Nernst Equation**  
Calculates the electrochemical equilibrium for a given ion:  
$$ E \ (mV) = {R.T \over z.F}ln{[ion]_{outside} \over [ion]_{inside}} $$, where:
    * $$E$$ is the equilibrium potential for the ion
    * $$R$$ is the gas constant (8.314 J.deg<sup>-1</sup>.mol<sup>-1</sup>)
    * $$T$$ is the temperature in Kelvin
    * $$F$$ is Faraday's Constant
    * $$z$$ is the ionic valency (e.g. +2 for Mg<sup>+2</sup>, -1 for Cl<sup>-</sup>)

* **Henderson-Hasselbalch**
Calculates the pH of a buffer solution:  
$$pH = pK_a + log{[A^-] \over [HA]}$$, where:
    * $$pH$$ is the pH of the solution
    * $$pK_a$$ is the pKa of the buffer
    * $$A^-$$ is the concentration of base
    * $$HA$$ is the concentration of acid

##Respiratory Laws
* **Modified Bohr Equation**  
The ratio of dead space to tidal volume ventilation equations the arterial - mixed-expired CO2 difference, over the arterial CO2.
$$ {V_D \over V_T} = {PaCO_2 - PE'CO_2 \over PaCO_2}$$

* **La Place's Law**  
The larger the vessel radius, the larger the wall tension required to withstand a given internal fluid pressure. For a thin-walled sphere, Wall Tension (T) is half the product of pressure and radius, i.e. $$ T = {P.r \over 2}$$

* **Alveolar Gas Equation**  
The alveolar PO2 is equal to the PiO2 minus the alveolar CO2/the respiratory quotient, i.e.:
$$ PA_{O_2} = Pi_{O_2} - {PA_{CO_2} \over R}$$




##Gas Laws
* **Boyle's Law**  
$$PV = K$$, i.e. pressure and volume are inversely related at constant temperature and pressure

* **Charle's Law**  
$$V = KT$$, i.e. volume and temperature are linearly related when pressure is constant.

* **Gay-Lussac's Law/The Third Gas Law**
$$P = k.T$$, i.e. pressure and temperature are linearly related when volume is constant.

* **The Universal Gas Equation**  
$$PV = nRT$$, i.e. combination of Boyle's, Charle's law combining each variable and the universal gas constant, R (8.13).

* **Henry's Law**  
The number of molecules of dissolved gas is equal to the partial pressure of the gas at the surface of the liquid

* **Graham's Law of Diffusion**  
Diffusion rates through orifices are inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight

* **Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures**  
In a mixture of gases, each gas exerts the pressure that it would exert if it occupied the volume alone.




##Cardiovascular Equations  
* **Fick's Principle**  
Flow of blood through an organ equals the uptake of a tracer substance by the organ divided by the concentration difference of the substance across it, i.e.:  
$$ \dot{Q} = {\dot{V}_{O_2} \over Ca_{O_2} - C\bar{v}_{O_2}} $$

* **Starling's Law of Fluid Exchange**  
Flow of fluid across the capillaries is proportional to the hydrostatic pressure difference and the oncotic pressure difference (times the reflection coefficient), all times by the filtraiton coefficient, i.e.:

$$ Net \ flow \ out = K[(P_c - P_i) - \sigma (\pi_c - \pi_i))] $$

* **Venous Admixture**  
Calculates the shunt fraction by identifying how much mixed venous blood must be added to ideal pulmonary capillary blood to produce the identified arterial oxygen content. 
$${\dot{Q}_S \over \dot{Q}_T} = {Cc'_{O_2} - Ca'_{O_2} \over Cc'_{O_2} - C\bar{v}'_{O_2}}$$
