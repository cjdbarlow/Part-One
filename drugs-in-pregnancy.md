#Drugs in Pregnancy

The Therapeutic Goods Administration classifies drugs for suitability in pregnancy based on the potential of a drug to cause:
* Birth defects
* Detrimental effects at birth
* Problems in later life

The classification system is:
* Valid only for the dose and route of administration listed
    * Does not apply in overdose
* Not hierarchical
    * 'B' drugs are not safer than 'C' drugs
    
##Categories
* **Category A**  
Taken by *large number* of women without detrimental effects.


* **Category B**  
Taken by a *limited number* of women without detrimental effect. Subclassified by results from animal studies into:
    * Category B1  
    Animal studies show no evidence of detrimental effect to the foetus.
    * Category B2  
    Animal studies are inadequate or lacking, but available data shows no evidence of detrimental effect to the foetus.
    * Category B3  
    Animal studies show evidence of foetal damage, but the significance of this in humans is unknown.
        
        
* **Category C**  
    * Drugs which have caused (or a suspected to cause) detrimental foetal effects, but without malformations
    * These effects may be reversible
    
    
* **Category D**
    * Drugs which have caused (or are suspected to cause) an increased incidence of foetal malformations or damage
    * May also have detrimental effects
    

* **Category X**

    * Should not be used in pregnancy, or when pregnancy is possible
