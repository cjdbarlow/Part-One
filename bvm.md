# Bag-Valve-Mask

<img src="\resources\bvm.svg">

## Components
Essential components:
* Self-inflating bag  
In various sizes:
	* Infant: 240mL
	* Child: 500mL
	* Adult: 1600mL
* Oxygen source
* Air inlet valve  
Draws room air into the bag if the oxygen reservoir is empty and the bag is still inflating.
* One-way valves  
Sit between the self-inflating bag and the:
	* Gas source  
	Refill valve prevents reflux of gas into the reservoir instead of into the patient.
	* Exhalation port
	Non-rebreathing valve prevents expiration into the self-inflating bag, and forces expiration through the exhalation port (or PEEP valve, if present).
* 15mm adaptor  
For mask or airway device.
* High pressure relief valve  
Pop-off valve prevents Pip rising excessively (usually at ~40-65cmH<sub>2</sub>O, depending on model).



Optional components:
* PEEP valve  
Partially occludes exhalation port to provide PEEP. May be built-in or sold separately.
* Oxygen reservoir  
Must be at least as large as the bag. Allows buffering of gas flow into the self-inflating bag (as peak flow will be less than that supplied from the oxygen source), and allows **100% O<sub>2</sub>** to be delivered provided the **minute ventilation** is **less** the **O<sub>2</sub> flow rate**.


## Method
Steps:
* Attach to supplemental oxygen
* Attach to mask or airway device
* Hand ventilate


## Pros
Logistics:
* Cheap
* Effective
* Widely available
* Portable
* Requires no power



Function:
* Can deliver close to 100% oxygen
* Minimal dead space
* Pop-off valve reduces risk of barotrauma
* Highly compatible  
15mm adaptor compatible with masks, LMA, ETT, and other in-line airway add-ons (ETCO<sub>2</sub>, bronchoscopic Y-piece, etc.).



## Cons
Logistics:
* Misassembly
Reusable BVM systems can occasionally have their valves inserted backwards, giving risk of barotrauma and failure of oxygen delivery.



Function:
* Less effective for spontaneous ventilation
	* Delivered FiO<sub>2</sub> may vary substantially between devices
	* Requires sufficient ventilatory effort to open one-way valves  
	Failure will result in air entrainment rather than oxygen.
* Lower FiO<sub>2</sub> delivered at high MV
* Bulky
* Easy to hyperventilate
* Unable to gauge lung compliance  
Risk of barotrauma.
* Difficulty assessing delivered tidal volumes
