#Electrocardiography
> Describe the principles behind the ECG

The ECG is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart, as measured by the sum of electrical vectors at the patients skin.

##Components
An ECG consists of:
* Electrodes  
Disposable, sticky components which act as conductors due to a silver/silver chloride coating. To reduce electrode impedance, skin should be:
    * Hairless
    * Dry
    * Clean
* Cables  
Shielded to prevent currents being induced and electrocuting the patient.
* Processor
* Monitor

###ECG Leads{#eint}
ECG **leads** are created by taking the **potential difference** between two electrodes, which varies by **0.5-2mV** through the cardiac cycle as myocardium depolarises. ECG leads are divided into:
* Limb leads  
Potential difference between limb electrodes:
    * I: RA to LA
    * II: RA to LL
    * III: LA to LL
* Augmented leads  
Potential difference between the average of the limb leads (called the **indifferent electrode**) and each individual limb lead.
    * Augmented leads are of much lower voltage and must be amplified
    * Three augmented leads exist (one for each limb electrode)
* Precordial leads  
Potential difference between the indifferent electrode and one of the six additional electrodes placed on the chest wall.


The relationship between electrodes and leads is described with **Einthoven's Triangle**:

##Method
* As the myocardial membrane potential changes across the cardiac cycle, a potential difference can be measured at the skin.
    * A depolarisation wave traveling towards the positive electrode (or a repolarisation wave traveling away) will cause an upward deflection in the ECG
* These potential differences are very small, and therefore need to be:
    * Distinguished from background interference  
    Several techniques exist:
        * **Common mode rejection**  
        Identical electrical activity occurring in multiple electrodes is likely due to interference rather than cardiac activity, and is removed from the measured signal.
            * A ground electrode is typically used for this purpose
        * ECG modes  
        ECGs can be set to varying levels of sensitivity.
            * Diagnostic mode  
            Responds to higher range of frequencies, but is at greater risk of interference.
            * Monitor mode  
            ECG responds to a lower range of frequencies, reducing interference but also resolution. This is common on 3-lead ECG.
        * High input impedance  
        Minimises signal loss.
    * Amplified  
    Frequencies in the desired signal range are amplified.

###Sources of Error
* Improve signal detection
    * Good adherence
    * Optimal skin contact  
    Ensure dry and hairless.
* Minimise external electrostatic forces
    * Earthed
    * Diathermy
    * Shivering

##Risks
* ECG electrodes can act as an exit electrode for surgical diathermy
