# Control of Breathing
> Describe the control of breathing

Ventilation is controlled by a feedback loop involving **inputs**, **integration and control**, and **effector** (i.e. the muscles of respiration) centres.

##Inputs
Inputs to the respiratory centre comes from a number of sensors:
* Peripheral Chemoreceptors
* Central Chemoreceptors
* Mechanoreceptors
* Other effects

Peripheral and central chemoreceptors are synergistic - i.e. responses sensed by both is greater than the sum of each effect.

###Peripheral Chemoreceptors
* Peripheral chemoreceptors include:
  * The **carotid body**  
  Located at the bifurcation of the common carotid artery, and are innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).
  * The **aortic body**  
  Located in the aortic arch, and innervated by the vagus (CN X).

They are stimulated by:
* **Low PaO<sub>2</sub>**  
  Peripheral chemoreceptors are stimulated by **low O<sub>2</sub> tension**

* **High PaCO<sub>2</sub>**  
  Peripheral receptors have a **rapid** (~1-3s) but **weaker** (~20% of response) to changes in CO<sub>2</sub>, compared to central chemoreceptors

* **Acidaemia**  
  (Carotid bodies only)
* **Hypotension**  

###Central Chemoreceptors
* Central chemoreceptors are located on the **ventral medulla**, and are **stimulated** by a **fall** in **CSF pH**.
  * H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> are ionised, and cannot cross the BBB by diffusion
  * Because of this, central chemoreceptors **respond indirectly** to **changes in arterial PaCO<sub>2</sub>**
    * Carbon dioxide is lipid soluble and freely diffuses into CSF
    * In CSF, carbon dioxide combines with water (catalysed by carbonic anydrase) to form H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.


* This slightly convoluted process gives the central chemoreceptors a number of special properties:
  * **Increased sensitivity**  
  Increased relative to plasma due to minimal buffering (as there is less protein in CSF)
  * **Respond to respiratory acidosis**  
  Fixed acid does not cross the blood brain barrier and so have a minimal response on CSF pH. **Cerebral hypoxia** increases **CSF lactate**, which will stimulate respiration.

####Mechanism of CO<sub>2</sub> Retention
* Prolonged respiratory acidosis (i.e. prolonged CSF acidosis) stimulates active secretion of bicarbonate into the CSF
* When pH normalises, the stimulation of central chemoreceptors ceases

* Similarly, renal absorption of bicarbonate increases, which normalises arterial pH and reduces peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation

###Mechanoreceptors
Stretch receptors in bronchial muscle are stimulated by overinflation, and stimulate the **apneustic centre** to reduce inspiratory volumes. This is the **Hering-Breuer reflex**.

###Other Stimulants
Other inputs which stimulate respiration include:
* Juxtacapillary receptors (J-receptors)  
Receptors in alveolar walls, potentially stimulated by oedema and emboli.
* Irritant receptors  
  Inhalation of noxious gases stimulates respiration
* Pain receptors
* Thalamus  
  Increased core temperature
* Limbic system  
  Emotional responses
* Cerebral cortex  
  Conscious control of breathing
* Muscle spindles  
Ventilatory response to exercise.

##Integration and Control
The respiratory centre is located in the **medulla** and the **pons**. It consists of four groups:
* **Dorsal Respiratory Group (DRG)**  
  Controls the diaphragm, and is so only involved with inspiration.
* **Ventral Respiratory Group (VRG)**  
  Controls the intercostal muscles, and so is involved in inspiration and expiration.
* **Apneustic Centre**  
  Modulates DRG function to prevent overexpansion. Loss of this area causes **abneusis** - long, deep breaths.
* **Pneumotaxic Centre**  
 Also modulates the DRG, increasing RR and decreasing V<sub>T</sub> to maintain MV.
