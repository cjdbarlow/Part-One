# Cardiac Cycle
> Describe the normal pressure and flow patterns (including velocity profiles) of the cardiac cycle

The cardiac cycle:
* Describes sequence of events that occur in the heart over one beat
* Consists of **two phases** divided into **six stages**
* Typically is descried as beginning in **late diastole** when the myocardium is relaxed and the ventricles are passively filling

Phases of the cardiac cycle:
* Diastole
    * Isovolumetric Ventricular Relaxation
    * Rapid Ventricular Filling
    * Slow Ventricular Filling  
    (The cycle begins here).
    * Atrial Contraction
* Systole
    * Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction
    * Ejection



##Phases of the Cardiac Cycle{#wig}

Events during each phase of the cardiac cycle are represented on **Wigger's Diagram**:

###Slow Ventricular Filling (Diastasis)
In slow ventricular filling:
* The AV valves are open and the semi-lunar valves are closed
* The ventricle is **relaxed completely** and fills slowly  
The ventricles have been mostly filled during rapid ventricular filling and so the pressure gradient is reducing.
    * The pressure in each ventricle is almost zero
* **Arterial pressure is falling**, as it is end-diastole
* **CVP is slowly rising** as the ventricle and atria fill  
This period occurs **after the y descent**.
* The **ECG** will show the beginnings of a **P-wave** at the end of this phase

###Atrial Contraction
The atria contract, and remaining blood in the atria is ejected into the ventricle. This supplies **10%** of the ventricular **filling at rest**, but up to **40% in tachycardia**.

In atrial contraction:
* **Arterial pressure** is still **falling**
* The **CVP** waveform demonstrates the **a** wave as atrial contraction also causes blood to reflux into the SVC
* The **ECG** will show the **PR interval**

###Isovolumetric Ventricular Contraction
Once the action potential passes through the AV node and bundle of His, ventricular contraction begins.

In isovolumetric contraction:
* Ventricular pressure rises, and the **AV valves close**  
This gives rise to the first heart sound, S<sub>1</sub>.
    * As ventricular pressure is still less than systemic vascular pressure, the semilunar valves remain closed
* **Arterial pressure** is still **falling**
* The **CVP** waveform shows the **C** (closure) wave, as the tricuspid valve herniates back into the RA during ventricular contraction  
There is a similar spike in LA pressure as the mitral valve also bulges back into the LA.
* The **ECG** will show the remainder of the QRS or the start of the QT interval  
    * Atrial repolarisation occurs at this stage, but is typically masked by ventricular depolarisation


###Ejection
When ventricular pressure exceeds arterial pressure, the semilunar valves open and ejection occurs. **Initial ejection is rapid**, but as ventricular pressure falls and systemic pressure rises the gradient falls ejection becomes slower.

During ejection:
* **Arterial pressure rises rapidly**, and is slightly less than ventricular pressure during this stage
* The **CVP** waveform shows the **x descent**, as the shortening RV pulls the RA down, rapidly lowering CVP
* The **ST segment** shows on the ECG as the ventricles are fully depolarised, though the  **T wave** may appear in late ejection

###Isovolumetric Relaxation
When contraction is complete, the ventricles begin to relax. **Inertia** means that ejection continues for a short time.

During isovolumetric relaxation:
*  The **semilunar valves close**  
This gives rise to the second heart sound, S<sub>2</sub>, and marks the beginning of isovolumetric relaxation.
    * This occurs when ventricular pressure falls below vascular pressure
* **Arterial pressure begins to fall**, interrupted by the **dicrotic notch** which is a brief increase in arterial pressure as the semilunar valves close
* The **v wave** is visible on the CVP waveform  
Due to atria filling against closed AV valves.
* The **end of the T wave** is visible on the ECG as ventricular repolarisation occurs

###Rapid Ventricular Filling
Most of ventricular filling occurs in this phase. This is because in early ventricular diastole the ventricle is **still relaxing** and so a **pressure gradient is maintained** between the atria and ventricle. 

During rapid ventricular filling:
* The **AV valves open** and ventricular filling occurs  
This occurs when atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure.
* **Arterial pressure is falling**
* The **y descent** occurs when the AV valves open, causing a rapid drop in CVP as the ventricles fill
* No electrical activity is produced - the ECG shows the TP interval
