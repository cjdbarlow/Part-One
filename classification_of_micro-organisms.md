#Classification of Microorganisms {#id}
> Describe the classification of micro-organisms, including viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi

Microorganisms can be classified as prokaryotes (**bacteria**), **viruses**, or **eukaryotes** (which include **fungi**, **helminths**, and **protozoa**).

##Bacteria
* Bacteria are **prokaryotic** organisms
* *Most* clinically relevant bacteria can be classified by **Gram stain** and **shape**[^1]
  * Gram stain separates bacteria according to their **cell wall composition**  
  It cannot be used on organisms that lack a cell wall, such as mycoplasma.
    * A **crystal violet** followed by an **iodine** solution is applied to the slide, which is then **washed with a solvent**
      * **Gram +ve** organisms will **retain the stain** due to their **thick peptidoglycan cell wall**, whilst gram negative organisms become colourless
    * A **safarnin stain** is then applied, which stains the **gram -ve** bacteria **pink**
  * Bacteria can also be classified by shape into:
    * **Cocci**  
    Appear round on microscopy.
    * **Rods**

Combining of these two systems classifies a large proportion of microbes:

|Examples:|Gram Positive|Gram Negative|
| -- | -- | -- |
|**Cocci**|*Staphylococcus Aureus*, *Streptococcus Pneumoniae*|*N. Meningitidis*, *N. Gonorrhoea*|
|**Rods**|*Listeria*, *Clostridium difficile*|*Escherichia Coli*, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*|

###Bacterial Subclassification
Additional testing can be done to further classify bacteria:
* **Catalase** testing is performed on **Gram positive cocci**  
Hydrogen peroxide is added to a bacterial sample, and in the presence of catalase will produce **oxygen**.
  * Catalase positive indicates Staphylococci
  * Catalase negative indicates Streptococci (and enterococci) 


* **Coagulase** testing is performed on Staphylococcal species  
Coagulase is an enzyme which cleavs fibrinogen to fibrin. The staphylococcal colony is added to rabbit plasma and incubated. In the presence of coagulase, fibrin is formed.
  * Coagulase positive strongly suggests *S. Aureus*
  * Coagulase negative examples include *S. epidermidis* or *S. saprophyticus* 


* **Haemolytic** testing is performed on Streptococcal species  
Bacterial colonies are added to blood agar, and the colour change (due to haemolysis) is noted.
  * **α haemolytic** organisms produce dark green agar, as methaemoglobin is produced by hydrogen peroxide produced by these organisms. Examples include:
    * *Strep. pneumoniae*
    * *Strep. viridans*
 * **β-haemolytic** organisms produce yellow agar from complete haemolysis. Examples include:
   * *Strep. pyogenes*
   * *Strep. agalactiae*
 * **γ-haemolytic** organisms leave the agar unchanged. Examples include:
   * *E. faecalis*
   * *E. faecium*


* Additionally, gram negative rods should be further classified into **pseudomonal** and **non-pseudomonal** organisms

##Viruses
Viruses consist of molecules of either DNA or RNA shielded in a protein coat. They require the use of host cell stuctures for reproduction and are therefore **obligate intracellular parasites**. They can be classified by **five** properties:
1. **DNA/RNA**  
  DNA viruses replicate in the cell nucleus using a host polymerase.
2. Double-**stranded** or single-stranded  
    3. *Most* DNA viruses are double-stranded (dsDNA)
    4. *Most* RNA viruses are single-stranded (ssRNA)
3. Negative-**sense** or positive-sense (**RNA viruses only**)  
    4. Positive-sense genomes may be translated directly into mRNA
    5. Negative-sense genomes require an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to translate them to a positive-sense strand prior to translation.
4. **Capsid Symmetry **  
   The protein coat may be either icosahedral or helical
12. **Enveloped** or non-enveloped  
    In addition to a protein coat, viruses may have a lipid membrane (acquired from the host cell) around their protein coat.

##Eukaryotic Organisms
Eukaryotic organisms include fungi, protozoa, and helminths, as well as plants and animals. They differ from prokaryotic organisms in a number of ways:

| Property| Prokaryotes | Eukaryotes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Chromosomes | Single, circular | Multiple |
| Nucleus and Organelles | None | Membrane bound nucleus and orangelles|
| Cell wall | Usually | In plants |
| Ribosome | 70S | 80S in cell, 70S in organelles |
| Size | 0.2-2mm | 10-100mmm |

* **Fungi** typically feed on dead/decomposing/the immmunocompromised and produce spores. They are subclassified into:
  * **Yeasts**  
  Yeasts are unicellular. They are divided into:
    * Candida
      * Albicans
      * Non-albicans
      More difficult to treat.
    * Cryptococcus
  *  **Molds**  
  Molds are are filamentous.
    * Aspergillus
    * Penicillium
  * **Dimorphus**
  Have characteristics of both yeasts and molds.
    * Histoplasma


* **Protozoa** are parasitic single-celled eukaryotes. They can be intracellular or extacellular.

* **Helminths** are parasitic multi-celled eukaryotes. They can be intracellular or extacellular. They are subdivided into tapeworms (cestodes), flukes (trematodes), and roundworms (nematodes).

##Footnotes
[^1] This classification does not capture spirochetes, mycoplasmas, chlamydias, and other less commonnly encountered organisms. A more complete classification uses six properties:

1. Cell Wall Stucture
    2. Flexible (e.g. Spirochetes)
    3. Rigid
    4. Non-existent (e.g. *Mycoplasma spp.*)
5. Morphology
    6. Unicellular
    7. Filamentous
8. Growth Location
    9. Extracellular
    10. Obligate intracellular parasites (e.g. *Chlamydia spp.*)
11. Gram Stain
    12. Gram positive
    13. Gram negative
14. Shape
    15. Cocci
    16. Rods
17. O<sub>2</sub> tolerance
    18. Aerobes
    19. Anaerobes (e.g. *Clostridium spp.*)
