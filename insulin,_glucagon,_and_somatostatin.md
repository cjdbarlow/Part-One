# Insulin, Glucagon, and Somatostatin
> Describe the physiology of insulin, glucagon and somatostatin.

##Insulin
Insulin is a **polypeptide** hormone, and is:
* Synthesised from **proinsulin** in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of **B cells** in the **Islets of Langerhans**
* Excreted via exocytosis in response to an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>
* **Minimally protein bound** with a **tiny volume of distribution**  
V<sub>D</sub> 0.075 L.kg<sup>-1</sup>, increased to 0.146 L.kg<sup>-1</sup> in diabetics.
* **Metabolised** in liver, muscle, and kidney **by glutathione insulin transhydrogenase**, with renal elimination of inactive metabolites  
Circulatory **half-life** of **~5min**.


###Actions of Insulin
Insulin binds to a specific insulin receptor (a membrane-spanning protein composed of α and β subunits)  on the cell membrane. The complex is internalised, and its effects are mediated by tyrosine kinase.

||Seconds|Minutes|Hours|
|--|--|--|--|
|**Muscle**|Increased glucose, amino acid, ketone, and K<sup>+</sup> uptake|Increased anabolism, decreased catabolism||
|**Fat**|Increased glucose (via GLUT4), amino acid, and K<sup>+</sup> uptake|Increased glycerol phosphate synthesis|Increased fatty acid synthesis|
|**Liver**||**Decreased**: gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis. <br><br>**Increased**: glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, protein synthesis, lipid synthesis||
|**General**|||Increased cell growth|

###Glucose Tolerance
Hyperglycaemia occurs in diabetes due to **decreased peripheral utilisation** as glucose uptake is reduced due to absence of or resistance to insulin. In addition, the suppressive effect of insulin on hepatic gluconeogenesis is absent or reduced. 

##Glucagon
Glucagon is a **polypeptide** hormone, and is:
* Synthesised in the **A cells** of the pancreas
* Has a circulating **half-life** of **~5min**
* Metabolised predominantly in the liver  
Secreted directly into the portal vein, and **undergoes first-pass metabolism** resulting in low circulating levels.

|System|Effect|
|--|--|
|**Liver**|Glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, glucose release, ketone formation|
|**CVS**| Inotropy|
|**Fat**|Lipolysis|
|**Metabolic**|Increased metabolic rate, GH release, somatostatin release, insulin release|

Secretion of glucagon is influenced by a number of factors:

|Stimulate Release|Inhibit Release|
|--|--|
|Hypoglycaemia and starvation|Somatostatin|
|Amino acids|Secretin
|Physiological stress: Exercise, infection|Free Fatty Acids|
|β-agonists|α-agonists
|Cortisol|Insulin|
|ACh|Ketones|
|Theophylline|GABA|

##Somatostatin
Somatostatin is a **polypeptide** hormone that:
* Inhibits secretion of other hormones including:
 * Glucagon
 * Insulin
 * Other pancreatic peptides
* May function as a neurotransmitter in the CNS
