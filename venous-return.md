#Venous Return

*This section describes determinants of cardiac output from the perspective of venous return. The relationship to and importance of [myocardial function](determinants_of_cardiac_output.md) is covered elsewhere.*

> Define the components and determinants of cardiac output

The venous system has two key cardiovascular functions:
* Blood reservoir  
Contains 65% of blood volume.
* Conduit for return of blood to the heart

Venous return is the rate at which blood is returned to the heart (in L.min<sup>-1</sup>). **At steady state**, venous return is equal to cardiac output, and can be expressed as:  
$$ VR = {MSFP - RAP \over RVR}$$, where:
* $$VR$$ is venous return
* $$MSFP$$ is the **mean systemic filling pressure**  
This is the mean pressure of the circulation when there is no flow. It is an indicator of circulatory filling, and is a function of circulating volume and vascular compliance.
    * Normal mean systemic filling pressure is **~7mmHg**  
* $$RAP$$ is the right atrial pressure  
An elevated RAP reduces venous return.
* $$RVR$$ is the resistance to venous return

This relationship can be expressed graphically:

* When venous return is 0, the measured right atrial pressure is an indication of mean systemic filling pressure

* Alterations to circulating volume and compliance affect both venous return and mean systemic filling pressure

* Alterations to the resistance to venous return affect venous return but mean systemic filling pressure is unchanged
    
##Factors Affecting Venous Return
Venous return will be altered by any of the variables in the above equation:
* MSFP
    * Volume  
    e.g. Haemorrhage, resuscitation.
    * Compliance  
* RAP
    * Respiratory pump  
    Negative intrathoracic pressure reduces RAP, improving venous return.
    * Positive pressure ventilation
    * Pericardial compliance
        * Constriction
        * Tamponade
* Resistance to Venous Return
    * Posture
    * Vascular compression
        * Obesity
        * Pregnancy
        * Laparoscopy


* Other factors affecting venous return
    * Skeletal muscle pump  
    Contraction of leg muscles in combination with an intact venous system propels blood back towards the heart.
    
##Interaction between Venous Return and Cardiac Function Curves{#sup}
Guyton's curve can be superimposed on Starling's curve to examine the interaction between venous and cardiac function over a range of conditions:
