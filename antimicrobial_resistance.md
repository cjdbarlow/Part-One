# Antimicrobial Resistance
> Describe the principles of anti-microbial resistance

Resistance occurs when the **maximal level** of the agent tolerated is **insufficient** to **inhibit growth**.

Resistance can occur broadly via two mechanisms:
* **Genetic Alteration**  
    * **Spontaneously**, through mutation and subsequent natural selection of resistant organisms
    * Transferal of resistance genes from organism to organism via **plasmids**


* **Protein Expression**  
Increasing or decreasing expression of proteins with subsequent change in efficacy of antimicrobials.

##Mechanisms
Specific mechanisms of resistance (which may be genetic alterations or changes in protein expression) include:

* **Prevent access to target**
  * Decrease permeability
    * Narrowing of porin channels  
    e.g. Streptococcal resistance to penicillins typically occurs by reducing access to PBPs.
    * Loss of non-essential transporter channels  
    e.g. Anaerobes have no oxygen-transport channel which prevents penetration by aminoglycosides.
  * Active efflux of agent  
  Increased efficiency or expression of efflux pumps. Can be:
    * Removed from cell
    * Trapped between cell wall layers  
    e.g. glycopeptide resistance in VRSA.


* **Alter antibiotic target site**
  * Changes in binding site protein will increase resistance to agents with low affinity
  * Over-expression of target protein
  * Synthesis of target-protecting proteins


* **Modification or Inactivation of Drug**
  * Metabolism of drug  
    e.g. β-lactamases hydrolyse β-lactam rings 


* **Modification of Metabolic Pathways**
  * Development of metabolic pathways to bypass site of action of antibiotic  
  e.g. Resistance to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole by allowing bacteria to synthesis or absorb folic acid.
