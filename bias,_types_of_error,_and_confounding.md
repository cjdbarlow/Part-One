#Bias and Confounding
> **Describe bias, **types of error, **confounding factors** and sample size calculations, **and the factors that influence them**

##Bias
Bias is a **systematic deviation from truth**, and causes a study to lack **internal validity**.

In a research study, an observed difference between groups may be due to:
* A true difference between groups
* An error  
Error can be due to:
  * Normal random variation, i.e. chance
  * A systematic difference, i.e. bias  
  Unlike error due to chance, the effect of bias cannot be reduced by increasing the sample size. 

###Types of Bias
| Type of bias | Description | Prevention |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Selection | Where subject allocation results in treatment groups that are systematically different, apart from in the intervention being studied | Randomisation |
| Detection | Where measurements are taken differently between treatment groups | Blinding |
| Observer | Where the data collector is able to be subjective about the outcome | Blinding, Hard outcomes|
| Publication | When negative studies are less likely to be submitted or published than positive ones | Clinical trial registries |
| Recall | Altered reporting of symptoms by patients depending on which group they have been allocated to | Blinding |
| Response | When patients who enroll for a trial differ from the population, limiting generalisability | Random sampling |
| Hawthorne effect | When the process of actually doing the study improves the outcome | Control group, masking study intent from patients and observers |

##Confounder
A confounder is **"a variable that, if removed, results in a change in the outcome variable by a clinically significant amount."**[^3] It is a type of bias which will result in a distortion of the measured effect.

A confounding factor must be:
* **Associated with the exposure** but **not a consequence of it**  
  A confounding factor cannot be on the causal pathway between exposure and disease  
  It must be present unevenly between groups to cause distortion of the measured effect
* **An independent predictor of outcome**  
  The confounding factor must also be a risk factor for the disease, but independently from exposure


###Controlling for confounding
####By Design
* **Randomisation**  
  All confounders (known and unknown) are distributed evenly between groups
* **Restriction**  
  Restricts participants to remove confounders  
  Results in reduced generalisablility and does not control all factors
* **Matching**  
  Pairing of similar subjects between groups  
  May introduce additional confounding, and matching by multiple characteristics is difficult

####By Analysis
* **Standardisation**  
  Adjust for differences by transforming data
* **Stratification**  
  Analyse the data in subgroups for each potential confounding factor
