# 2016A Question 02 
# Draw and label a circle breathing system. Explain its advantages and disadvantages.


## Examiner Report
89% of candidates achieved a pass in this question


Main Points expected for a pass:
* A legible and accurate diagram of a circle breathing system.
* Correct components in the correct order.
* A reasonable list of advantages and disadvantages.
Additional points could be gained for:
* Further detail on how components were arranged.


Common problems:
* This question was generally well handled.
* Some candidates spent too much time on one half of the question.
* There was confusion regarding the location of the APL valve.
* Illegible handwriting
* Poor layout and structure and evidence of poor time management
* The main reason for failing this question was insufficient core knowledge

### Define: 
Circle system is a semi-closed, re-breathing anaesthetic circuit.

### Diagram

### Pros

|Main features|<p>- Volatile anaesthetic: Accurate, minimal waste</p><p>- O<sub>2</sub>: Accurate, can deliver 100%</p><p>- CO<sub>2</sub>: Efficient removal by:</p><p>&emsp;- Scavenger (earlier in expiratory limb – to spare CO<sub>2</sub> absorber))</p><p>&emsp;- CO<sub>2</sub> absorber (later in expiratory limb)</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Secondary features|<p>- Minimal dead space: Only tubing distal to Y piece and HME</p><p>- Low resistance</p><p>- Humidification and warming by CO<sub>2</sub> absorber</p>|
|Logistics|<p>- Sodalime remote from airway hence minimal dust inhalation</p><p>- ↓ Waste</p><p>- ↓ O<sub>2</sub> pollution</p>|

### Cons

|Main features|<p>- Equilibration between FGF and circuit-patient gas composition is dependent on FGF rate</p><p>- FiO<sub>2</sub> can fall below 0.21 if low fresh gas flow rate and low fresh gas PO<sub>2</sub> (since semi-closed)</p><p>- Sodalime degradation products: CO, Compound A</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Secondary features|<p>- Higher resistance than Mapleson E and F due to valves and longer tubing</p><p>- Possibility of injury if dysfunctional valves, scavenging system</p>|
|Logistics|<p>- Expensive</p><p>- Complicated</p><p>- Bulky</p><p>- Atmospheric pollution from scavenging</p>|
