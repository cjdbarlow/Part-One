# 2019B Question 05 
# Outline the safety features of currently used mechanical variable bypass vapourisers.


## Examiner Report
62.6 % of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


Two important domains needed to be addressed in the answer. Both of these relate to ensuring that a known, reliable concentration of vapour is delivered from the vaporiser. It was difficult to pass without addressing both of these key areas.


1. Vaporisers are only compatible with a specific volatile agent. This is because each agent has a different saturated vapour pressure. Safety measures to achieve this include: calibration of the vaporiser and splitting ratio for the specific SVP; geometrical shape of filling ports and bottles; labelling; and colour coding.
2. Vaporiser output remains constant across a range of operating conditions. This requires temperature, flow, and pressure compensation. Each one of these needed to be explained in terms of how it works and why it is a safety feature.


Other safety features that gained marks included: only one vaporiser can be turned on at once; the maximum setting on the control dial is well below SVP; the control dial has to be pushed in before it can be turned on; anti-spill mechanism; a fluid level indicator window; leak test using suction bulb on common gas outlet as part of machine check; MRI compatibility.
Beginning the answer with a simple definition of “variable bypass” was sensible, and scored some marks.


The following were areas of difficulty:
* Lengthy explanations of how a vaporiser works, complete with diagrams, but without connecting any of this information with safety
* Temperature compensation was often poorly described – many candidates could not explain the concept of a heat sink, and the metal vaporiser casing was often described as “insulation”
* Referring to volatile agents as “gas”
* Referring to the different geometrical shape of filling ports as the “pin index” system
* Desflurane vaporisers were often included – these are not variable bypass
* Vaporisers were described as being part of the anti-hypoxia safety mechanism
* A variety of (non-existent) high and low pressure alarms were variably described
* It was common for candidates to list multiple other safety features of anaesthetic machines generally – only those related to vaporisers could earn marks

### Introduction

|Key features|<p>- Pressure gradient provided by fresh gas supply (cf. inspiratory effort)</p><p>- High resistance</p><p>- Unidirectional</p><p>- Agent-specific</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Reason for use|- Most volatile agents are lethal at SVP<br>  e.g. Sevoflurane 160mmHg = 22% ≈ 11 MAC|
|Tec 5|<p>- Vapouriser chamber producing volatile-saturated gas</p><p>- Bypass chamber</p><p>- Splitting ratio controlled by a user-controlled dial.</p>|
|Tec 6|<p>- Vapourising chamber at 39°C → 2atm pressure</p><p>- Computer-controlled injection into the bypass stream</p>|

### Problems and Solutions

|Problem:|Prevention:|
| -- | -- |
|Spilling → Liquid in bypass chamber → Supersaturated|- Specifically designed channels prevent spill|
|Wrong drug|<p>- Specific shape and size of filling hole and plug</p><p>- Colour coding of vapouriser and bottle</p>|
|Two vapourisers running at once|- Interlock|
|Disconnection, leak|<p>- Same interlock device</p><p>- Machine self-testing</p>|
|Empty → No volatile delivery|<p>- Alarms on machine (low MAC)</p><p>- Alarms on vapouriser: Desflurane</p>|
|Inaccuracy at extremes of flow rate|<p>- Very high: Wicks, baffles, bubbling ensures proper saturation</p><p>- Very low: Machine limits low flow rate e.g. 0.2L/min</p>|
|↓ temp → ↓ SVP → ↓ %|<p>- Bimetallic strip: Different coeff of thermal expansion</p><p>- Copper heat sink: High SHC and high thermal conductivity</p><p>- Tec 6: Heat to 39°C → 2 atmospheres → Injection (BP 24°C, close to room temp, would be dangerous if unheated and uncontrolled)</p>|
|Pumping effect|<p>- Adequate length of tubing between vapouriser and circuit</p><p>- Unidirectional valve between vapouriser and circuit</p><p>- Inspiratory valve prevents back pressure from patient</p>|
|MRI incompatibility|- ?|
|Transport|- ?|
