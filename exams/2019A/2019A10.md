# 2019A Question 10 
# Describe the effects of sevoflurane on the following regional circulations: Cerebral, coronary, pulmonary, hepatic and uteroplacental. Do not discuss specific organ effects.



## Examiner Report
19.9 % of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


To pass this question required correct identification of the effect of sevoflurane on the regional circulations without major errors. As per Ohm’s law the effect on regional blood flow is dependent on both the perfusion pressure as well as regional vascular resistance. At anaesthetic concentrations of sevoflurane, autoregulation is preserved in all of these regional circulations except for the uteroplacental unit.


Pleasingly, many candidates recognised that the placental circulation is already maximally dilated so high dose sevoflurane may decrease uteroplacental flow due to a decrease in systemic perfusion pressure. Sevoflurane causes dose dependent vasodilatation. The majority of candidates recognised this effect but few could describe the mechanism. Very few candidates noted that the effects of sevoflurane on all these regional circulations at anaesthetic doses are modest and of little clinical concern in the healthy individual. Most candidates described effects that may be seen at doses above one MAC which was still an acceptable answer.


Common errors were: Answers that focused on systemic circulatory effects; not addressing all the circulations; and discussing organ effects eg uterine tone. In their discussion of coronary blood flow candidates invariably used the incorrect term ischaemic preconditioning as opposed to volatile or anaesthetic preconditioning - they are not the same thing but share a similar mechanism. Marks were not deducted for this minor terminology error, however.

### Flow Physiology

|Ohm’s Law|$$Flow rate = {P1 – P2 \over Resistance}$$|

|Poiseuille's Law|<p>$$\mbox{Resistance (to laminar flow)} = {8 \times length \times viscosity \over \pi \times radius^4}$$</p><p>- Hence radius is the major factor</p>|

### Cellular Effects

## Footnotes
- From the Maekawa et al paper: At 0.5 MAC, mean values for local blood flow were reduced in every grey matter tissue
- However, none of the individual changes are statistically significant due to a large standard deviation
- One interpretation:
	- It is unlikely that a universal decrement in mean blood flow between 0 MAC and 0.5 MAC was due to chance
	- Statistical significance likely would have been reached had sample sizes been larger
	- These findings are consistent with the curves for CBF vs CMRO<sub>2</sub> and CMRO<sub>2</sub> vs MAC
- An alternative interpretation:
	- There is no evidence for significant change in CBF between 0 MAC and 1 MAC
	- In this range, the indirect vasoconstriction (via ↓ CMRO<sub>2</sub>) and the direct vasodilation roughly cancel each other out
	- This is consistent with the leftward/upward shift in the CBF vs MAP curve that occurs with any concentration of volatile anaesthetic
	- See the Eger-Stoelting version below
