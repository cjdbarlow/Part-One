# 2020B Question 10 
# Discuss the structure and function of the NMDA receptor and briefly describe the interaction of ketamine with this receptor


## Examiner Report
This question was simple in scope, in that it asked about a common and important CNS receptor, and the way in which ketamine interacts with that receptor.

The NMDA receptor is a voltage-sensitive ligand-gated receptor. There is some difference in detail between the recommended textbooks regarding sub-unit structure, so variations were accepted. Detail regarding the AMPA receptor in providing initial depolarization, the Mg2+ plug, glutamate and glycine binding, and ionic currents were necessary.

Many candidates offered that the NMDA receptor caused long-term potentiation and various chronic pain phenomena, but very few attempted to describe a mechanism that related to NMDA activation and intracellular events.

There were some good descriptions of where ketamine bound to NMDA, and the effect it had.

A number of candidates did not offer that one of the effects of ketamine was general anaesthesia.

There were a number of repeated errors that showed lack of general understanding. The NMDA is not a metabotropic (G-protein linked) receptor. Substance P and the NK-1 receptor are not involved in NMDA activation. The influx of Cl- ions is not excitatory.

Pharmacokinetic data for ketamine was neither asked for nor rewarded. Organ-based pharmacodynamic information for ketamine did not receive marks..

- Physiological role

### General Description

|Type|Ligand-gated voltage-dependent glutamate receptor<br>  (others: AMPA, kainate)|
| -- | -- |
|Location|<p>- Spinal cord: Especially dorsal horn 2° nociceptive afferents</p><p>- Brain: Especially hippocampus</p>|
|Structure|<p>- Transmembrane</p><p>- 2 x NR1 subunits (pore-forming)</p><p>- 1 x NR2A subunit (binds glutamate)</p><p>- 1 x NR2B (binds glycine)</p>|
|Binding sites|<p>- Orthosteric site: For glutamate</p><p>- Coactivating site: Glycine</p><p>- Phencyclidine site: Ketamine, PCP</p><p>- Pore: Blocked by Mg2+</p><p>- N<sub>2</sub>O and Xe: Site unknown (antagonists)</p>|

### Activation Process

|1. Priming|<p>- Activation of adjacent AMPA or NK-1 receptors</p><p>- Partial depolarisation → Removal of Mg2+ plug</p>|
| -- | -- |
|2. Coactivation|<p>- Binding of glycine</p>|
|3. Activation|<p>- Binding of glutamate</p><p>- Ion flux (Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx > Na<sup>+</sup> influx = K<sup>+</sup> efflux)</p><p>- Cell-dependent downstream effects</p>|

### Effect of Ketamine

|Receptor|<p>- Non-competitive antagonist at PCP site</p><p>- ↓ Receptor activation</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Cellular effect|<p>- ↓ Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated cell activation</p><p>- ↓ 2nd messenger signalling</p><p>- ↓ Gene transcription</p>|
|Analgesic effect|<p>- ↓ Receptor excitability = Wind-up → ↓ Hyperalgaesia, allodynia</p><p>- ↓ Synaptic reinforcement = Long-term potentiation</p><p>- ↓ Acute somatic and neuropathic pain</p><p>- ↓ Opioid requirement</p><p>- ↓ Progression to chronic pain</p><p>- Less utility once chronic pain established</p>|
|Other use|<p>- Dissociative general anaesthesia, including single agent use</p><p>- Poorly understood effect on cell toxicity</p><p>- ↓ Ca<sup>2+</sup> mediated excitotoxicity</p><p>- ↑ Neuronal damage in young rodents</p><p>- ?Beneficial effect in depression</p>|
