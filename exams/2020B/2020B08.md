# 2020B Question 08 
# Discuss the adverse environmental effects of anaesthetic agents in current use


## Examiner Report
The question required:
* A basic knowledge of the terms “greenhouse gas”, “ozone layer” and “global warming”
* An explanation of how inhalational agents affect the wider environment
* An explanation of how intravenous agents affect the wider environment


Things that were done particularly well:
* Ranking of agents by degree of impact
* Acknowledging the large amount of non-recyclable, solid waste produced
* Mentioning the adverse effects of N<sub>2</sub>O upon theatre staff


Things that were done poorly:
* Accurately differentiating between the basic terms
* Understanding the effect of propofol on the wider environment

## Model Answer
Structure:
* Definitions
* List of agents


### Definitions

|Greenhouse Gas|<p>- Substance that absorbs and emits infrared radiation</p><p>- e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, methane, ozone</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Anthropogenic global warming|<p>- Warming of average temperatures on earth caused by greenhouse emissions arising from human activity</p><p>- Many detrimental environmental effects</p>|
|Ozone layer|<p>- O<sub>3</sub> Rich region in the stratosphere</p><p>- Absorbs UV-B</p>|
Structure: Of agents
*Listed in descending order of toxicity.*

|Desflurane|<p>- Direct AGW: 6 hours at Fi 7% ≈ 1000kmg driving</p><p>- 0.02% metabolised; also resistant to environmental breakdown</p><p>- Greater impact mostly due to long half life</p>|
| -- | -- |
|Nitrous Oxide|<p>- Direct AGW: 6 hours at Fi 50% ≈ 500km driving</p><p>- Depletes ozone layer</p><p>- Chronic exposure can cause neuropathy, teratogenicity, miscarriage in health care workers due to inactivation of methionine synthetase </p>|
|Sevoflurane|<p>- Direct AGW: 6 hours at Fi 3.5% ≈ 50km driving</p><p>- ~5% metabolised</p>|
|Propofol|<p>- Minimal impact on AGW, even after taking into account syringe driver, manufacture, procurement</p><p>- Improperly discarded propofol is toxic to marine life</p><p>- Syringes and tubing contribute to medical waste</p><p>- Almost 100% metabolised; metabolites excreted in urine</p><p>- Environmental effects of metabolites unknown</p>|
|Ketamine|<p>- Minimal impact</p><p>- Can be used as a sole agent</p><p>- Minimal effects of ABC</p><p>- Hence reduces need for other disposable equipment</p>|
|Neuraxial/regional local anaesthetics|<p>- i.e. Bupivacaine, ropivacaine, lignocaine</p><p>- Minimal direct impact</p><p>- Can be performed without sedation or general anaesthesia</p><p>- Hence reduces need for other disposable equipment</p>|
