# 2018A Question 09 
# Discuss the determinants of renal blood flow.


## Examiner Report
32% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.

Main points expected included an appreciation that renal flow exceeds metabolic demands for the purpose of high glomerular filtration to regulate body fluid volumes and solute concentrations. Also, marks were gained for demonstrating understanding that renal blood flow follows haemodynamic principles and how this is affected by autoregulation (both myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback). Integral to this is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system of which some detail was expected.


Simply listing the anatomical flow path did not attract credit unless accompanied by an explanation of how the anatomy affects resistance e.g. many parallel pathways reduce vascular resistance. Tubuloglomerular feedback was frequently not well described. A common mistake was to link a given change in NaCl concentration to the incorrect change in arteriolar tone and subsequently blood flow; the effect on GFR was frequently neglected.


Better candidates correctly described the effect of angiotensin II on renal arteriolar tone, renal blood flow and GFR. This group also appropriately mentioned the role of the sympathetic nervous system and other mediators.

|Cortex|<p>- 500mL.min<sup>-1</sup>/100g</p><p>- Low EO<sub>2</sub> 0.2</p><p>- For fluid/electrolyte/acid-base homeostasis</p>|
|Medulla|<p>- 20mL.min<sup>-1</sup>/100g</p><p>- High EO<sub>2</sub> 0.8</p><p>- To preserve hyperosmotic interstitium</p><p>- Vulnerable to ischaemia</p>|

### Vascular Anatomy

|Arteries|<p>- Renal artery / interlobar artery / arcuate artery / interlobular artery / afferent artery / efferent artery</p>|

|Veins|<p>- Mirror image configuration</p>|

### Myogenic Autoregulation

|Description|- Almost constant flow if renal perfusion pressure 70-170mmHg|

### Hormonal Autoregulation

|Stimuli for renin release|<p>- ↓ Afferent arteriolar pressure → ↓ Renal baroreceptor stretch</p><p>- ↓ GFR → ↓ NaCl to macula densa → ↑ PGE2 and ↓ adenosine</p><p>- ↓ MAP → Baroreceptor reflex → ↑ SNS output onto β<sub>1</sub> adrenoceptor</p>|

|Stimuli for aldosterone release|<p>- CRH → ACTH (necessary for synthesis, minor release stimulus)</p><p>- Angiotensin 2 (major)</p><p>- Hyperkalaemia (minor)</p>|
