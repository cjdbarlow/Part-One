## 2021A Question 4
# Describe the factors that affect afterload for each of the right and left ventricles.


## Examiner Report
54.6% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


The major domains assessed in this question were:

* A definition of afterload
* The differences between the left and right ventricles
* Extrinsic determinants of afterload as described by the Hagen-Poiseuille law
* Intrinsic determinants of afterload related to the Law of Laplace.


Typically answers that attempted to answer the questions “why?” and “how?” scored significantly better than those that presented simple lists. Credit was given for answers that demonstrated a better understanding of the factors and were able to integrate them into clinical examples, such as the effect of cardiac dilatation, ventricular hypertrophy and positive pressure ventilation. There were some excellent answers that illustrated in depth explanation of mechanisms and focused on factors that had opposite effects on each ventricle, highlighting the difference in afterload between the left and right side of the heart.


Common problems were:
* Incorrect recall of both the Hagen-Poiseuille law and the Law of Laplace
* Discussion of intrinsic factors (Laplace) without discussion of extrinsic factors (Hagen-Poiseuille) and vice versa
* Few candidates articulated that the radius is the most important determinant of resistance due to it’s fourth power
