# 2004B Question 11
# Explain how a pulse oximeter works. Do NOT discuss the potential sources of error.


## Examiner Report
29.9% of candidates achieved a pass in this question.


The major domains assessed in this question were:

* System components
* Beer-Lambert law
* Differential absorption
* Isolation of the pulsatile component
* Converting ratio R to SpO2


Common problems with the answers included:

* Incorrect use of the terms “SaO2”, “SpO2”, and “PaO2”
* The misconception that only infrared light is used in pulse oximetry
* Limited or no application of the Beer-Lambert law to pulse oximetry
* Incorrect or contradictory statements about the absorption spectra for oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin
* Absent or insufficient explanation of the pulsatile or “alternating current” (AC) compartment.

## Physics

|Property|Mechanism|
| -- | -- |
|Beer-Lambert principle|<p>- $$Absorption \propto concentration$$ of the absorbing substance in the medium (Beer’s law)</p><p>- $$Absorption \propto distance travelled$$ (Lambert’s law)</p><p>- Describes the basis for, but not the functioning of, the pulse oximeter</p>|
|Known absorption spectra|<p>- 940nm: O<sub>2</sub>Hb > HHb</p><p>- 660nm: O<sub>2</sub>Hb < HHb</p>|


### Device

|Property|Mechanism|
| -- | -- |
|Components|<p>- Probe on the finger, nose, ear</p><p>- Two monochromatic LEDs on one side, rapid on and off</p><p>- Photodetector on the other side</p><p>- Electrical cable</p><p>- Processor</p><p>- Display: SPO<sub>2</sub> and plethysmograph</p>|
|Function|<p>1. Pulsatile signal isolated</p><p>- Excludes venous and tissue absorption</p><br><p>2. Ratio of absorbances calculated</p><p>$$ R =$$ $${Pulsatile_{660} / Non-Pulsatile_{660}} \over Pulsatile_{940} / Non-Pulsatile_{940}$$</p><br><p>3. Ratio correlated with SaO<sub>2</sub> derived from experiments</p><p>- R 0.4 → 100%</p><p>- R 1 → 85%</p><p>- R 2 → 50%</p>|
