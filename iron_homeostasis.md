# Iron Homeostasis
>	Describe the normal nutritional requirements

Approximately 3-5g of iron is found in the body as:
* **Oxygen-carrying globin molecules**  
Haemoglobin (~70%) and myoglobin (~5%).
* **Catalyst** for biological reactions (~25%)  
Catalase, peroxidase, and cytochromes all require iron.

##Absorption
Dietary iron comes in two forms:
* Haeme groups  
Directly absorbed via specialised transport proteins.
* Dietary iron salts  
  * Ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) iron is soluble, and is absorbed via facilitated diffusion across the enterocyte membrane
    * Reduced acidity of the stomach will reduce the absorption of ferrous iron
  * Ferric (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) iron precipitates when pH > 3, and so cannot be absorbed independently by the small bowel.
    * A pathway may exist for absorption of ferric iron from soluble chelates


* Once in the enterocyte, iron can be:
  * Stored, bound to **ferritin**
  * Transported via **ferroportin** out of the enterocyte, where it is then oxidised to ferrous iron and bound to **transferrin**

##Regulation
* Excretion is uncontrolled
* Regulation of iron levels is only by absorption
* **Hepcidin** is a liver protein which inhibits the action of ferroportin
  * High hepcidin prevents iron transport from the enterocyte
  * Hepcidin is deficient in haemochromatosis
