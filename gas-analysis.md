#Oxygen Analysis
> Describe the principles of measuring oxygen concentration

As oxygen is a molecule containing two similar atoms, its partial pressure cannot be determined using infrared techniques (unlike CO<sub>2</sub>). Oxygen content of a gas is instead determined using:
* Paramagnetic analyses
* Fuel Cells

##Paramagnetic Analysis
Principles of paramagnetic analysis:
* Oxygen is paramagnetic  
This means it is attracted by magnetic fields, but does not propagate the field. 
    * This is because its two unpaired valent electrons have the same spin.
* Many other gases weakly repelled by magnetic fields (diamagnetic)

* The attraction of a gas mixture to a magnetic field is therefore proportional to its oxygen content
* Many different methods exist which use this property to determine oxygen content

###Pressure Method
* Gas tested flows into a tube
* A reference gas flows into a parallel tube
* Both gases then pass through:
    * Flow restrictors
    * Magnetic field  
    This is being turned on and off at ~100Hz.
* The gases combine in the magnetic field
* The greater the oxygen content of the gas, the more it will move into the magnetic field  
This movement creates a negative pressure behind the gas.
* The pressure difference between the tested gas and the reference gas is proportional to the oxygen content of the test gas.


###Temperature Method
Used in many modern devices.
* Gas flows through a magnetic field, causing the particles to align  
This changes the thermal conductivity of the oxygen molecules.
* The change in thermal conductivity of the gas mixture is proportional to the oxygen content
* This is detected by measuring current passing through a heated wire

###Pros
* Accurate
* Rapid response time  
Modern analysers can identify breath-to-breath variation in FiO<sub>2</sub>.
* Don't require regular calibration

###Cons
* Water vapour reduces accuracy
* Interference from other paramagnetic gases
    * Nitric oxide  
    Effect is minimal as nitric is delivered in far smaller volumes than oxygen, and is only weakly paramagnetic.

##Fuel Cells
Fuel cells rely on reduction of oxygen to measure oxygen partial pressure. They consist of:
* Oxygen permeable membrane
* KOH solution  
This contains:
    * Lead anode  
    Lead is consumed as the fuel cell operates.
    * Gold cathode

###Method
* Oxygen diffuses across the membrane into the potassium hydroxide solution
* At the cathode:  
$$O_2 + 4e^- + 2H_2O \rightarrow 4OH^-$$
* At the anode:  
$$Pb + 2OH^- \rightarrow PbO + H_2O + 2e^-$$
* The oxygen consumption is proportional to the current generated, which is measured with an ammeter

###Pros
* No power required
* Small
* Accurate

###Cons
* Will accumulate nitrogen in the presence of N<sub>2</sub>O  
Results in an under-reading of PO<sub>2</sub>.
* Must be replaced after 6-12 months
* Requires regular two-point calibration  
21% and 100% oxygen are used.
* Relatively slow response time compared to paramagnetic analysers  
~20s.
