#Neuraxial Blockade
> <p style="color:purple";>Describe the physiological consequences of a central neuraxial block</p>

Central neuraxial blockade refers to blockade of fibres in the spinal cord by administration of intrathecal or epidural local anaesthetic.

##Respiratory Responses
An increasing level of block will lead to greater effects:
* Thoracic  
    * Impediment to active expiration and expectoration due to blockade of intercostals and abdominal wall musculature
    * Loss of vital capacity
    * Loss of some accessory muscle use
* Cervical  
Impediment due to diaphragmatic blockade.

##Cardiovascular Responses
Occur due to blockade of sympathetic chain fibres in the thoracolumbar region.

An increasing level of block will lead to greater effects:
* Sacral  
Parasympathetic blockade only. Minimal CVS effects.
* Lower thoracic/lumbar  
Arteriolar and venous vasodilation in lower abdomen and lower limbs, causing a fall in SVR, BP, and GFR.
* Upper thoracic  
Loss of cardioaccelerator fibres above T5, causing a reduction in heart rate and contractility, compounding hypotension due to fall in SVR.
* Cranial Nerves  
Vagal blockade will reduce PNS tone and attenuate some of the loss of SNS tone.
* Brainstem  
Inhibition of vasomotor centre with profound fall in CVS parameters.

##CNS Responses
An increasing level of block will lead to greater effects:
* Cervical  
Horner's syndrome (miosis, anhidrosis, ptosis) due to loss of sympathetic trunks.
* Cranial nerve
Pupillary dilation due to CN III blockade.
* Brainstem and Cerebral Cortex 
Anaesthesia due to blockade of the reticular activating system and thalamus.
