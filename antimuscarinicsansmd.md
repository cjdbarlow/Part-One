# Antimuscarinics (Cardiac) {#id}

*Antimuscarinics used for bronchodilation are covered under [Antimuscarinics (Respiratory)](antimuscarinics.md), whilst [atropine](atropine.md) is covered separately.*


Antimuscarinics are as competitive, reversible antagonists of ACh at the muscarinic receptor. They are divided into:
* Naturally occurring **tertiary amines**  
These can cross the blood-brain barrier, and have central effects.
    * Atropine
    * Hyoscine
* Synthetic **quaternary amines**  
Do not cross the blood-brain barrier.
    * Glycopyrrolate
    


|Property|Glycopyrrolate|Hyoscine
|--|--|
|**Class**|Quaternary amine. Muscarinic antagonist|Tertiary amine
|**Uses**|Bradycardia, antisialagogue|Antisialagogue, motion sickness
|**Presentation**|Clear, colourless solution at 200μg.ml<sup>-1</sup>. Incompatible with diazepam and thiopentone.|Racemic, only L-isomer active
|**Route of Administration**|IV/IM|PO, SC
|**Dosing**|200-400μg|200-600μg|
|**Absorption**|Minimal PO absorption - not used via this route.| < 50% PO bioavailability
|**Distribution**|Crosses placenta but not BBB, V<sub>D</sub> 0.5L.kg<sup>-1</sup>|V<sub>D</sub> 2L.kg<sup>-1</sup>|
|**Metabolism**|Minimal hepatic hydrolysis|Extensive metabolism by hepatic esterases
|**Elimination**|Renal of 85% unchanged drug|Renal of metabolites
|**Resp**|Bronchodilation, antisialagogue|Bronchodilation, greatest antisialagogue effect
|**CVS**|Initial bradycardia due to partial agonist effect. Reverses vagal causes of bradycardia, may cause tachycardia in doses >200μg. HR peaks at 3-9 minutes following administration.|Least likely anticholinergic to cause tachycardia
|**CNS**||Most likely anticholinergic to cause central anticholinergic syndrome
|**MSK**|Anhydrosis||
|**GIT**|Reduced oral and gastric secretions, and gastric motility|Reduced oral and gastric secretions, and gastric motility|
|**GU**|Difficult micturition||
