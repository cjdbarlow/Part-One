# Cough Reflex
> Explain the pathways and importance of the cough reflex

Coughing:
* Is an airway protection reflex
* Involves deep inspiration followed by **forced expiration against a closed glottis**  
The sudden opening of the cords causes a violent rush of air at **>900km.h<sup>-1</sup>**, removing irritants and secretions from the airways.

##Sensation
Vagus afferents have exquisitely sensitive light touch and corrosive chemical receptors in the larynx, carina, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli.

##Integration
Vagal afferents synapse in the medulla, triggering an autonomic sequence of events.

##Effector
A series of processes occur in three phases:
* Inspiratory phase  
A close to vital capacity breath is taken.
* Compressive phase  
Effort closure of the epiglottis to seal the larynx, followed by a violent contraction of abdominal musculature and internal intercostals, causing a rapid rise in intrapleural pressure to >100mmHg.
* Expulsive phase  
Wide-opening of the cords and epiglottis, causing a violent expiration
    * Compression of the lungs causes narrowing of the noncartilagenous airways and increases turbulent flow, removing adherent material from the tracheobronchial tree
