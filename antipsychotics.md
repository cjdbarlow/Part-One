# Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are drugs used for the management of psychoses and thought disorders. They have a complicated mechanism of action with effects on multiple receptors:
* Central dopamine (typically D<sub>2</sub>, but varies with agent) antagonism  
Responsible for the antipsychotic properties
* 5-HT<sub>2</sub> antagonism


* Other receptors which are quantitatively less important:
    * H<sub>1</sub> antagonism
    * α<sub>1</sub> antagonism
    * Muscarinic ACh antagonism


Based on their affinity to various receptors, they are (loosely) classified as either:
* **Typical** or 1<sup>st</sup> generation antipsychotics  
Higher affinity for D<sub>2</sub> receptors (subsequently less blockade of 5-HT<sub>2</sub>), causing a greater effect on 'positive' symptoms' and a greater incidence of extrapyramidal side effects
* **Atypical** or 2<sup>nd</sup> generation, which typically have fewer motor effects  
Have greater effect on negative symptoms.

##Common Features of Antipsychotics

|Property|Drug
|--|--|
|**Uses**| Behavioural emergencies, schizophrenia/psychosis
|**CVS**|QT prolongation
|**CNS**|Apathy, ↓ initiative, ↓ response to external stimuli, ↓ aggression. No loss of intellectual function. 
|**Endocrine**|↑ Prolactin (typicals)
|**Haeme**|Leukopenia and agranulocytosis (predominantly clozapine, but can be all)
|**Metabolic**|Weight gain, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia (all atypical > typical)
|**Other Toxicities**|Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, EPSE

###Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
**Antipsychotic Malignant Syndrome** is rare and presents similarly to MH, with a rapid rise in body temperature and confusion. It has a high mortality (up to 20%).

###Extra-Pyramidal Side Effects
Motor disturbances from antipsychotic use are termed EPSEs, and are divided into two main types:
* **Acute Dystonic Reactions** are involuntary movements and parkinsonian symptoms. They are:
    * More common with typical agents
    * Decline with ongoing use
    * Reversible with cessation of the agent

* **Tardive dyskinesia** is similar to ADR, except:
    * Involuntary movements are more pronounced and disabling
    * It occurs with long term use (10-20 years)
    * They are **irreversible**, and worsen when therapy is stopped
