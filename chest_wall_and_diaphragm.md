#Chest Wall and Diaphragm
> Describe the structure of the chest wall and diaphragm and to relate these to respiratory mechanics.

The chest wall is formed by the ribs and intercostal muscles:
* **Ribs**  
Slope anteroinferiorly, and are connected by the external, internal, and innermost intercostal muscles.
* **Intercostal muscles**  
  * External intercostals slope anteroinferiorly
  * Internal and innermost intercostals slope inferoposteriory
* **Diaphragm**  
Complex dome-shaped membranous structure, consisting of a central tendon and peripheral muscles
  * Performs the majority of inspiratory work of breathing
  * Able to dramatically increase intraabdominal pressure, so is essential in:
    *  Coughing
    *  Vomiting
    *  Sneezing
  * Role in maintaining lower oesophageal sphincter tone
  * It has three perforations:
    * **T8** for the **vena cava** (eight letters)
    * **T10** for the **oesophagus** (ten letters)
    * **T12** for the **aorta**, thoracic duct, and azygos vein

##Inspiration
* During **inspiration**, the **diaphragm** and **external intercostal** muscles **contract**
  * Diaphragm pushes the intrabdominal contents down, increasing thoracic volume and generating a negative intrathoracic pressure
    * Diaphragm is supplied by the phrenic nerves from C3/4/5. 
  * External intercostals pull the ribs anterosuperiorly, which increses the cross-sectional area of the chest, further increasing thoracic volume (and negative pressure)
    * Intercostal muscles are supplied by intercostal nerves from the same spinal level
    * Paralysis of the external intercostals does not have a dramatic effect on inspiratory function provided the diaphragm is intact


* **Accessory muscles** include **sternocleidomastoid** and the **scalene**, which elevate the sternum and first two ribs respectively. They are active in hyperventilation.

##Expiration
* Expiration is passive during quiet breathing as elastic recoil of the lung will return them to FRC
* When minute ventilation is high, expiration becomes an an active process:
  * **Abdominal wall** muscles (rectus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, transversus abdominis) contract, raising intrabdominal pressure and forcing the diaphragm up
  * **Internal** and **innermost** intercostals contract, pulling the ribs **downwards** and **inwards**, further decreasing thoracic volume



##Respiratory Mechanics in Spinal Injury

* Paralysis of the abdominal wall muscles (e.g. spinal injury) has significant affect on respiratory mechanics:
  * In the initial phases of injury, spinal shock results in a flaccid paralysis of the abdominal wall
    * Intrabdominal pressure is low, and so the diaphragm moves inferiorly  
    This results in a higher FRC but limits tidal volumes, as contraction of the diaphragm only increase thoracic volume by a small fraction.
    * Nursing in a supine position causes the abdominal contents to push the diaphragm superiorly, causing:
      * Lower FRC
      * Greater proportional expansion with respiration, improving tidal volumes
  * Once spastic paralysis ensues, the abdominal wall is rigid and the patient can be sat up
