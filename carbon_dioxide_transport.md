CO<sub>2</sub> is produced in the mitochondria during the citric-acid cycle as a product of metabolism.
* There is **~120L** of carbon dioxide in the body  
A total of 1.8L.kg<sup>-1</sup>, 1.6L.kg<sup>-1</sup> of which is in relatively inaccessible compartments.
* Normal elimination (and, at steady state, production) of carbon dioxide is **200ml.min<sup>-1</sup>**

##Carbon Dioxide in Blood
In blood, CO<sub>2</sub> is stored as:
* Bicarbonate (90%)
* Dissolved gas
* Carbamino compounds

|Form|Arterial Blood|Additional CO<sub>2</sub> in venous blood|
|--|--|
|Bicarbonate|90%|60%|
|Dissolved|5%|10%|
|Carbamino compounds|5%|30%|

###Bicarbonate
* CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses freely into erythrocytes, where it can be catalysed by carbonic anhydrase to produce bicarbonate:  
$$CO_2 + H_2O \Leftrightarrow H_2CO_3 \Leftrightarrow H^+ + HCO_3^-$$
* To maintain bicarbonate production, the products (H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) are then removed:
  * **H<sup>+</sup>** ions are **buffered** to **haemoglobin**  
  $$HbO_2 + H^+ \Leftrightarrow HHb + O_2 $$
  * Intracellular **HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>** is then exchanged with extracellular **Cl-** via the BAND3 membrane protein
    * This is called the Hamburger, or **Chloride Shift**
    * Chloride entering the cell draws water in along its osmotic gradient, **increasing the haematocrit of venous blood** relative to arterial blood

###Dissolved Gas
* As per **Henry's Law**, the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in blood is proportional to the PaCO<sub>2</sub>
* As carbon dioxide is 20x as soluble as oxygen in water, dissolved carbon dioxide contributes much greater proportion of carbon dioxide *content* than dissolved oxygen does to oxygen content

###Carbamino Compounds
* CO<sub>2</sub> can bind directly to proteins (predominantly haemoglobin), which displaces a H<sup>+</sup> ion:  
$$Hb + CO_2 \Leftrightarrow HbCOO^- + H^+ $$
  * The H<sup>+</sup> ion is then buffered by another plasma protein (also predominantly haemoglobin)  
    $$Hb + H^+ \Leftrightarrow HHb $$
* Bound CO<sub>2</sub> does not contribute to the partial pressure gradient
* Carbamino compounds are only a small contributor to overall CO<sub>2</sub> carriage, but contribute about one third of the arterio-venous CO<sub>2</sub> difference due to the **Haldane effect**  
The Haldane effect states that deoxyHb binds CO<sub>2</sub> more effectively than oxyHb. This is because:
  * DeoxyHb is a **better buffer** of **H<sup>+</sup>**  
  pKa of deoxyHb is 8.2, compared to that of oxyHb which is 6.6.
    * Enhanced buffering contributes ~30% of the Haldane effect
  * DeoxyHb forms carbamino compounds more easily
  Deoxy-Hb has 3.5x the affinity for CO<sub>2</sub> than Oxy-Hb.
    * This forms ~70% of the Haldane effect



###CO<sub>2</sub> Dissociation Curve{#curve}
This curve plots PCO<sub>2</sub> against blood CO<sub>2</sub> content in ml.100ml<sup>-1</sup>.

<img src="resources\co2-dissociation-curve.svg">

Key points:
* Mixed venous CO<sub>2</sub> content is 52ml.100ml<sup>-1</sup>, at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 46mmHg
* Arterial CO<sub>2</sub> content is 48ml.100ml<sup>-1</sup>, at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 40mmHg
* Approximately 50% of the arterial-mixed venous difference occurs due to the upwards shift of the curve, which is due to the Haldane effect  
This is the mechanism for changes in PO<sub>2</sub> affecting the CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation curve.


##Removal of CO<sub>2</sub> {#tr}
CO<sub>2</sub> dissolves from pulmonary arterial blood into the alveolus down a concentration gradient. As inspired CO<sub>2</sub> is negligible, PACO<sub>2</sub> is a function of alveolar ventilation and CO<sub>2</sub> output, given by the equation:

$$PACO_2 = {CO_2 \ output \over \dot{V}_A}$$

Simplified, PaCO<sub>2</sub> is inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation:

$$PACO_2 \propto {1 \over \dot{V}_A}$$

##Distribution of Carbon Dioxide{#vent}
CO<sub>2</sub> in the body can be considered as a three-compartment model:
* Well-perfused (blood, brain, kidneys)
* Moderately-perfused (resting muscle)
* Poorly-perfused (bone, fat))

* Each of these tissues has a different time-constant, such that a mismatch of ventilation with metabolic activity may take **20-30 minutes** to equilibrate across compartments
* Therefore hypoventilation and hyperventilation have different effects on PCO<sub>2</sub>:
    * **Hyperventilation** causes a rapid decrease in PCO<sub>2</sub> in blood, subsequent (slower) redistribution from peripheral compartments
    * **Hypoventilation** causes a rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub>, the rate of which is determined both by production and distribution into plasma
      * With **no ventilation**, PCO<sub>2</sub> rises at **3-6mmHg.min<sup>-1</sup>**
        * Due to the Haldane effect the PaCO<sub>2</sub> will rapidly increase during passage through the pulmonary capillary (despite the fact that carbon dioxide *content* is unchanged) as the proportion of OxyHb increases
      * Therefore:
        * PaO<sub>2</sub> is more sensitive at detecting early hypoventilation provided PAO<sub>2</sub> is normal
        * Steady-state PCO<sub>2</sub> gives the best indication of adequacy of ventilation
          * In acute hypoventilation, produced CO<sub>2</sub> is preferentially stored in tissues, decreasing CO<sub>2</sub> elimination
          * In acute hyperventilation, CO<sub>2</sub> is mobilised from tissues resulting in increased CO<sub>2</sub> elimination

###CO<sub>2</sub> Cascade
|Region|Value (mmHg)|
|--|--|
|Mixed Venous|46|
|Alveolar|40|
|(Arterial)|40|
|Mixed-expired|27|

* Venous CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses into the alveolus, reaching equilibrium with arterial PCO<sub>2</sub>
* Alveolar CO<sub>2</sub> is then diluted by dead space gas, resulting in a lower ME'CO<sub>2</sub>
